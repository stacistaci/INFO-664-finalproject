in a cab by the river where I could get by
====================

====================
and carry it as far as
====================
and they say Come on over
====================
While I wait
====================
with which I've never been near
====================
While they wait in the wings
====================
in a field full of them
====================
We are saying thank you
====================
Your eyes
====================
the hope of the dying
====================
the Stream of Friday
====================
The eyes started from your head
====================
whether it's for company or simply to be here
====================
who kept saying thank you
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
when they saw me
====================
what would you have me?
====================
In Time
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
from my mortafalls
====================
embrace set me beside
====================
And pray to the Father
====================
Of course I know the whole story
====================
while it was
====================
and to be sustained
====================
for the briefest of journeys
====================
There were the goats and the calves
====================
and
====================
The blind men kept saying Come on over
====================
or at least that is what they said
====================
and there at the foot of the wall a fox with a muzzle
====================
with the notes of bells chiding them
====================
Your good name and your calling
====================
somewhere where I could be
====================

====================

====================
when they are gone.
====================
the roomy trees eating their own meals
====================
the patience of the maids
====================
betrayals so long repeated
====================

====================
With curves like those between arms
====================
The ways of the dead
====================
Like a thread through a needle
====================
where I had not been
====================
so the birds came back and started the bees were all

====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
a word about which I cannot say
====================
Hearing
====================
and the gleaming medals of the disfranchised
====================
In Time
====================
the fear of the woods
====================
in the gaps between columns
====================
whenever it was
====================
with my whole body at their mouths
====================
The bells stop when they are over
====================
steep as branches
====================
Oh cloud of white light
====================
in time they came to an end
====================
each word a mirror in
====================
so they strove to keep them
====================
To the anonymous old woman
====================
The sleeves the bells singing
====================
which was the real me
====================
Except the hired hands
====================
pale and worn out and needs feeding
====================
in the dark where there were few
====================
the nights gone by the eyes
====================
in the hopes it might come to the attention
====================
than the mountains where I had not been
====================
and invented the paper lantern
====================
The frame their houses
====================
exploded into swirling tubular clumps
====================
many years longer
====================
have learned from others who have gone before me
====================
to listen
====================
(Far Company
====================
There we had all been
====================
For longer than by now I can believe
====================
or at least thought so far as to suppose
====================
which we might do with one dry branch of our own
====================
where it is not present
====================
He said
====================
in the gaps between columns
====================
in another day I the day when I was old
====================
and the numbers stay the same
====================
All the way down
====================
we have invented the unknown
====================
are not an old tongue saying
====================
oh God we are sending you
====================
The ash will not die
====================
wherever there was a god
====================
to be sustained by its dark breath
====================
than any thing I have seen before on earth
====================
yet they make no sound
====================
Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows
====================
No what is that
====================
without understanding
====================
which I hear as far away
====================
I believe so
====================
Grow warmer at night
====================
Here comes the white whale to see
====================
still they play
====================
with so little thought
====================
then without warning he ran
====================
in the full moonlight that evening
====================
to meet in the open field
====================
or letters to whom I said
====================
|
====================
Who are the compatriots
====================
The river one
====================
yet neither has I.”
====================
Toward the end of the paper there were few what were rich in yellow coins
====================
|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in the other I come to
====================
that morning
====================
Whose?
====================
* * *
====================
these words say what I am
====================
were filled with the most simple sorrow
====================
several of the windows looking out over the garden
====================
That door did not lock
====================
no music
====================
which I know not how
====================

====================
then step by step I shuffle among the stones
====================
in what country do you
====================
In the cells next to me
====================
which I have heard and comprehended
====================
which I have seen my share of
====================
as though they were still unborn
====================

====================
This is how we live
====================
What a blessing it is to exist
====================
I bow to you
====================
Cable said
====================
that this design may help to explain
====================
Hearing
====================
were listening
====================
He had told me so many times that I could do no such thing
====================
Wandering
====================
a rising star
====================
whether for long walks in the garden
====================
you who are born with eyes
====================
no note of his weariness.
====================
somewhere ahead when I was a boy
====================
but what is it
====================
who are we to know you
====================
and consigned to time
====================
them if they could
====================
and carried away into the Night
====================
The wells have fallen in and have
====================
in the game of cards and by the time I had caught sight of a card game-keeper juggler
====================
With disheveled heads and a wiry snout
====================
all the while seeming to be
====================
those who are never the same
====================
full of its own design and its own meanings
====================
On a sodding river
====================
you were not there
====================
But this am I
====================
as though I had said it first. But if a fly had followed me the same way twice
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
there for the sacrifices
====================
Of God we are already taught to laugh
====================
The others humbly followed them
====================
before the sun went down and stars appeared in the trees
====================
with its waving flags waving
====================
with its haystack and hayrides strewn about
====================
And grant to him
====================
which we might have given
====================
Of broad plains the rocks hang
====================
It is I who is standing
====================
they said
====================
With bells running in the sky
====================
to the names of
====================
and now for the ride on
====================
that it remembered I stood watching its eyes
====================
To whom I said thank you
====================
where I had not been
====================
Neither my father nor my mother
====================
oh Perdita
====================
With bells and sirens ringing beside them
====================
What is the tongue
====================
dripping from me
====================
still wet leaves of a cherry tree
====================
and now for the ride back.
====================
Grows colder by the day
====================
and the voices of the men
====================
[Hearing voice
====================
which came with me before the games were over
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
I offer my life to save it
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
but it is not there at all
====================
to be sustained with unburnished radiance
====================
a road with many names carved into it
====================
those eyes long ago he saw
====================
and carried away to sleep
====================
surprised at the light of day
====================
You would think you had learned something from death
====================
but one day it turned out that I was speaking—

====================

====================
which I have seen you at Babel
====================
Might it bow before me
====================
They don't wear hats they don't wear this hat
====================
as though it were still possible to be who you are
====================
with no echo
====================
what is the tongue
====================
I believe they have come to ask what shall I do
====================
Whose?
====================
on a dark day
====================

====================
There I stood
====================
of what was there left
====================
which are lit with white and there is a roof on each side
====================
far from here
====================
to hear them
====================
I put mine
====================
of the woods beside
====================
whether it be at home or with others
====================
Come along with me
====================
and risk taking
====================
Of course not again.

====================
or put out of his mind what is the matter
====================
In the Twenties
====================
everywhere you turned
====================
Bread
====================

====================
But I have seen you smile like a mirror
====================
I might have guessed from their voices
====================
Invisible Woman
====================
What is the tongue
====================
To the name of Cthulhu
====================
Was a rank and the learned the dead
====================
yet we will never meet
====================
early in the morning what with the blankets the air is getting warmer
====================
they are full of sleep
====================
have they forgotten the names
====================
Hiding
====================
after Cable we all learned
====================
of Nihil Consummata
====================
which was not said before
====================
Let them go on
====================
still they play the harp
====================
whether it's in the late evening weather or the sunlight
====================
and the harbors
====================
with one end of it going round and round in circles
====================
Oh juggler
====================
Now
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
after a while you are almost there
====================

====================
who make the notes of waking words
====================
to hear their troubles through to the present
====================
the wells have fallen in and have dried
====================
and endoftext
====================
whether its the last we hear
====================
to go away and live
====================
you will find the rank hollow
====================
or at least they always are
====================
unheard by
====================
an intermingled of color
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
there were no voices
====================
of the same river
====================
the eyes started from your head
====================
with the difference that they made with it
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
each with its margin
====================
betrayals so long repeated
====================
invisible though it is
====================
and so we escaped.
====================
in the square we are all about
====================
Oh Blankombley
====================
At times at Babel
====================
but his voice is smaller and his sight is wider
====================
when they are gone.”
====================
that are the ways of the city
====================
bodies stacked like columns or the tall
====================
Grow up like a house of cards
====================
that Cable spoke of
====================
Invisible Cable
====================
these were the folds
====================
in a field away I can hear the scratch and flare
====================
that night a white dove came running over the churchyard
====================
that night I was still listening
====================
You will not see me
====================

====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
and destroyed
====================
Loss of Soul
====================
have turned into corpses
====================
Consider now what might have been. As for the woman
====================
although it is the whole body
====================
when they are gone
====================
Do they understand me?
====================
after putting my tongue to your tongue
====================
without note the tongue moves the haystack
====================

====================
although they will explain later
====================
The camel has rung
====================
to the funeral pyre
====================
On the first day of the year when I was young
====================
a path of bloodletting farther down
====================
you who are old and bleeding from your Sin
====================
over our heads
====================
Whose garments were his thoughts
====================
 * *
====================
With no god
====================
and through the nights a bole overaul
====================
or the noise of the little boat-fires
====================
And the dreams I have
====================
not looking where I was any more I turned away from those eyes staring back
====================
Be here the flies have fallen. Here comes the noise of the little boat to be
====================
in the thirties when there were a lot of us
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
where I had not been
====================
these days let us pray
====================
that carried them down halls full of white men
====================
you never knew you
====================
of ignorance
====================
The Night of the Shirts
====================
And though I see him now
====================
Leaving no stone unturned
====================
and plunged into the unknown
====================
Of disheveled feet
====================
Among the stones below me.
====================
you have set free of me
====================
and the bells stop
====================
the way out the door
====================
is there any one small thing I have to say
====================
Hearing
====================
in front of me
====================
You can hear me going where I am
====================
Once I heard the scratch and claw as they ran
====================
and said to myself,

====================
pumping oxygen to the old man
====================
to be sustained
====================
which is how I met
====================
That have come to me
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
