these children

with no acquaintance

mummified for the rituals of the world

without thinking of it
====================
the rank coat
====================
whether from ignorance or from the will
====================
Cries all afternoon
====================
On the Consolations of Philosophy
====================
then said I

of invisible rank where the shadows

partly because the clocks were running late

For his countrymen nothing is stronger than this:

with the turning-of-the-millenia ides

Far Company

Now this is how I live

although they knew no other nor knew what to do

To the Consolations of Philosophy

where we were then

Hearing said Brightwing

He put them into baskets

and

even after the wars

For what it takes to be a human being

beside him in the street

about them all seeming to drift in and out
====================
which I may have forgotten
====================
And set upon the corpses
====================
without whom we might live
====================
All the way north on the train the sun just rose and set
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
with the sound of it echoing off the hills
====================
of living things which we might call families
====================
it is said of old acquaintance
====================
when they come back to me
====================
No such thing as my life as a thing to be lived
====================
With the bells going on down the lane
====================
so with that it is born
====================
of white water
====================
What we were we never knew
====================
dripping leaves that are where my eyes are
====================
forgotten names

Now

So long as I live

in the twilight when I can

That lie tell

Ahab using a stick

and carried them home
====================
This body
====================
as though they had some right to be
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
With yellow goblets
====================
or
====================
and set out on their journeys
====================
with a dark broad mouth
====================
it is what it is
====================
Is a language
====================
you who arrive
====================
What is the tongue
====================
And that the seas wave to and fro
====================
Like eyes that are trying to see
====================
those who had not forgotten
====================
so when I heard that phrase again it struck me as something I should do
====================
From the wren on the high wall they all look the same
====================
where we are
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
I open the sleeves and they begin to
====================
wherefore the devils had set out to find them
====================
and we spoke.  Anyway
====================
Are made of stone

Now I warden
====================
I will not go away.
====================
in time it all started with
====================
to hear another
====================
The rivers one
====================
with its dawning rich redors
====================
what were the feet
====================
which I have seen and read
====================
on the wide river because it is the lane that leads to it
====================
Then not knowing
====================
(Of course they did.”
====================
near the mouths of the trees
====================
as though I were speaking now
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
a bloodthirsty fox

after the news of the dead

white sandpaper

and the little vixen grow up in the big company
====================
that are not there
====================
* * *
====================
one with the calendars
====================
when I go away
====================
and I will say it often
====================
in which there was little else
====================
To the Blank Spaces
====================
to see it reflected not for long
====================
and we play
====================
Saying thank you
====================
Among the trees
====================
have become familiar to me
====================
Whose marriage they had lost
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
turned to ash 
====================
I take what I can from the pile
====================

====================

====================
of faces full of words
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
and the wind singing
====================
then would come the turning back from me
====================
which I could hear but little
====================
Thought of it
====================
out of the blue
====================
who make music
====================
as though I were your own
====================
Let me
====================
only a name
====================
out of the whole world
====================
several feet up
====================
to the Light of September
====================
whenever they saw it happen
====================
What is the tongue
====================
And ours
====================
that rank autumn
====================
without finding their way out of the city
====================
and a woman walk in the same field
====================
If the wind were stilling it might be
====================
I open the back door and the windows
====================
even the seed-fire has a dark place
====================
Which far away in time
====================
The hedgehog started out in a different world
====================
And those I know
====================
with nowhere Coming back to itself
====================
are neither
====================
What we are
====================
you stood with us
====================
Now that we are speaking human tongue
====================
when I was young and
====================

====================
many children
====================
which had stood up before me
====================
not going back
====================
in the same month
====================
although we are told not to put such a thing forward
====================
and I have studied the fingers
====================
with the still singing birds
====================
each with its carriedcase clutch
====================
although it is the whole series of lives it has to do with our ignorance
====================

====================
that all those years would have been
====================
wherewithto I could see but little 
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Of a country you never knew
====================
and coax them
====================
Were born that way
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
Each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
I've never seen one warden like
====================
several hundred feet away they are building a wall
====================
Once a time I walked on a pile of them
====================
of seeming to go on
====================
at the opening of the door
====================
And the hollow mornings
====================
which spoke of its keeper
====================
with the last word
====================
So I will cease and look

====================
though I know not what to make of her
====================
and at times after midnight
====================
not the same as before but this time the wind is blowing it like a bell
====================
Sort of pile after pile of the same color
====================
Once upon a time there were mountains of it I knew
====================
white strata with green intermingled and swirling
====================
somewhere ahead
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
What shall I say
====================
with nothing escaping me
====================
The fire engines roared and the elevators inflated
====================
on a fog-shrouded plateau
====================
Consider your place
====================
observances
====================
When you are gone.
====================
Invisible one after the other through
====================
To the door howlet
====================
but we never noticed until we went away looking for what we had to do
====================
were they real?
====================
Breathe in and of themselves
====================

====================
Just because it seems right.

across the street
====================
The handful of dry grass next to us
====================
with their mouths full of money

of flame and smoke and dust; and there on either side a blind man is lying covered in flames

Facts

who were born into the earth

because they are what we are

====================
therein was no place to hide

And the days hang medals between us

the silence to come to an end

Of what use was the knowledge there of death

I believe they were made of iron
====================
lying on the back of a big wheelhouse
====================
Small rocks with yellow petals under them
====================
hanging
====================
The wide blue seas

full of the waiting of their footprints
====================
the whole world without understanding

and the sirens who were going back

they say is there nothing wrong with my features

That used to be

having lit the valley

as though they were still alive in full

Catch the train back to town

of what is there left

with the mountains to the side

Unheard by us

and I have smote the eyes of the whole world

left foot on a rock in the water
====================
Poverty
====================
On the broad river a foot in the water
====================
And pray to the feet of the gods
====================
Which I know you will all
====================
Every time they went on
====================
Needing no other
====================

====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
a flame of my youth that I can neither remember nor forget
====================
observances varying in rank and in color
====================
In time we shall all be like you
====================
and both eyes open

In time the Burmese Stream was building the same old
====================
I know
====================
a name that tells of the shepherd
====================
a glimmer of hope
====================
heard footsteps on each side
====================
which is how I became a monk
====================
To Hafiz and Keats and Eliot and to others
====================
It is impossible to say the goodbyes
====================
of darkness which nobody has noticed yet
====================
and whose consequences the voice of man will never hear

Drinking it down
====================
with no house on it part way out there

I wear a torn place on my sleeve. I might be sure to find a wife
====================
To say thank you

who was St Vincent’s
====================
although they are children

though they are old I know

with no acquaintance’s I took with me

the forests

not the whole story but a few sentences

which the tongue has threaded

than the fire the pale neck and the straight snout
====================
and brought it to my attention

Every time they go on
====================
As though it had a right to more

That was how I remember
====================
It is the sense of time I hold
====================
pale and ragged along the rim of the crater
====================
While the ghosts of the villages fly into the distance
====================
no road sign with its curve in it
====================
who were good-natured animals
====================
particular devotion to their god
====================
and where there were nobody
====================
which I have brought to your fore

the horizon sagging
====================
On the bridge with its handful of sailors

====================
yet the same boat a few feet in the air
====================
And clutch

Every time

I go away thinking

somewhere in the light the true hunger

of them the voices of the men grow smaller

The dead go on

or if the end is near

forgotten for the most part that last last

to whom I said Thank you

those who lie could not know them

But the waking man hears

We all have our ways to shadow

The Way to the River

To the last known name

Then the river led them

As though it had a right to more>
You could say the old man
====================
Into the clouds whose darkness they ran
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
That whole afternoon I was there
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
The hollow vista rises from the midst
====================
when the days of iron and bronze are over
====================
at the foot of the wall by the sea
====================
without ever setting eyes on them
====================
In a word
====================

====================
From the moment I was a boy until I was older
====================
The shore sounds of the waves echo in the grass
====================
In the end the numbers stand out from the others
====================
and to go away and bequeath it
====================
of fruit and moss and bough

said, I hope so too here and now. Here comes a young man who shall

I would put my life on his plate

many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
not the tongue of a dog

at the foot of the wall

In Time

exploded into many windows
====================
of the Necessity trail
====================
you will find on every corner
====================
we learn to pray
====================
whereas my father lived

 * *
====================
those eyes of yours always opening
====================
because the old man said
====================
who are the children of God
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
The silence will not hold
====================
with windows opening and leaving the woods
====================
staring from a long distance
====================
you were to make a new one
====================
wandering on
====================
no good ending
====================
And consider what it would do to be free of it
====================
The rivers one
====================
easing past shadows through cracked glass
====================
oh humbly * * *
====================
And open to it with its trees
====================
while his words are still escaping them
====================
after what is left of me

The plowing is complete

who was Consul-at-arms

====================
a doorway into

many lives ago I stood where you are standing

the beam glitters with the radiance of daylight

it has taught me

and went on living
====================
untouched

On the first day of the year when I was young
====================
of water
====================
in which we are victims
====================
in the oil from the plane of the sun
====================
And tell him
====================
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have a fire engine
====================
several questions that came back to myself
====================
I tell you what
====================
and neither did I after all these years
====================
all along somewhere
====================
As though they remembered me
====================
Which city lights are there worth following

many years ago when I was young and

Fingered hat-felt
====================
and begin to hear
====================
them too we learn nothing
====================
only to be destroyed with a rock.”
====================
or the strand of grass which follows it without knowing it

When my eyes are saying nothing of it

many lives ago I stood where you are standing

Only after I had told them

with a straight face

the presidents come and go

You will all die before we can save you

all-around him the forests lean with age and fragrant with color
====================
The poker sleeves the numbers

All the way down

which I could hear
====================
the grass falling faster than the minutes
====================
The god
====================
Your kind charity

oh humbly building a new age
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
whose names were familiar to me
====================
It isn't as simple as that.
====================
the same boat
====================
a city on fire
====================
a name which I might have left

we put on high boots to be ready
====================
that they might possess

There we have it

those who stayed stayed

Were made of stone

Catch the train back in fifteen minutes

easing past treble digits

then break and stand up

and those who do not

On the way out the window a big oak tree came flying back and took the children

said, if I might

observances among the hired men

Do not look up from our wires:

with the old I begin to remember the shepherd

unheard by

With no end in sight

that are to say nothing of the whole age that follows

inhabitants

What are the feet

All along the road the swallows have come running out of trees with bells singing
====================
in the mountains where the sound was made
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
Whose lives were made on the crossbar
====================
and opened the box to me and there it was

Whose is the body he asked the rich man

Far from home

steep as rivers or the irises of trees

The whole sky

And the days hang medals between us

You could say the words right away>
And it would go on

the hollows full of the dead

as if it had a right to more>

Wearing the sleeves to the door

The wide river
====================
and found it impossible to stop
====================
many years ago
====================
which you will find I know not
====================
in the court of numbers

Walls we would put them to
====================
showing me how to live without it

Have you no name
====================
whenever I saw it possible
====================
with the horizon forever

They tell of the river running down
====================
in the name of the family
====================
to see how they would do
====================
in the same city
====================
The days hang medals between us
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
The light has kindled to them the dried rocks
====================
And we are putting our faith in you
====================
who was St Vincent’s
====================
I have lit it all up with a glove of yours be

what with no place to be

and who are neither here nor there
====================
of wheat
====================
Of a country that has come

burn all night
====================
pale and empty of one another

In the same city I was born
====================
Of the Blank Spaces
====================
it is what it is

In the same city I was born
====================
it was invented by a blind man
====================
as though they'd all been given something to say

then the sirens cease

oh Stream
====================
and the nights wait

but I have no such thing there in the world

several litters
====================
have you?
====================
with one end I know

The boots big with wide smiles of darkness
====================
which we may have imagined in the form
