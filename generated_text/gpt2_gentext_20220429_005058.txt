====================
that stank of incineration but that warm night
====================
these children
====================
with no acquaintance
====================
mummified for the rituals of the world
====================
without thinking of it
====================
the rank coat
====================
whether from ignorance or from the will
====================
Cries all afternoon
====================
On the Consolations of Philosophy
====================
then said I
====================
of invisible rank where the shadows
====================
partly because the clocks were running late
====================
For his countrymen nothing is stronger than this:
====================
with the turning-of-the-millenia ides
====================
Far Company
====================
Now this is how I live
====================
although they knew no other nor knew what to do
====================

====================
To the Consolations of Philosophy
====================
where we were then
====================
Hearing said Brightwing
====================
a whole life

====================
He put them into baskets
====================
and
====================
even after the wars

For what it takes to be a human being
====================
beside him in the street
====================
about them all seeming to drift in and out
====================
which I may have forgotten
====================
And set upon the corpses
====================
without whom we might live
====================
All the way north on the train the sun just rose and set
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
with the sound of it echoing off the hills
====================
of living things which we might call families
====================
it is said of old acquaintance
====================
when they come back to me
====================
No such thing as my life as a thing to be lived
====================
With the bells going on down the lane
====================
so with that it is born
====================
of white water
====================
What we were we never knew
====================
dripping leaves that are where my eyes are
====================
forgotten names
====================
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood

Hearing
====================
of color

With a beginning

Now

with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
hurt and bewilderment
====================
Like ghosts to the eyes</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't seem to remember
====================

====================
So long as I live
====================
in the twilight when I can

Toward the Light Horseman
====================
That lie tell
====================
Ahab using a stick
====================
and carried them home
====================
This body
====================
as though they had some right to be
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
With yellow goblets
====================
or
====================
and set out on their journeys
====================
with a dark broad mouth
====================
it is what it is
====================
Is a language
====================
you who arrive
====================
What is the tongue
====================
And that the seas wave to and fro
====================
Like eyes that are trying to see
====================
those who had not forgotten
====================
so when I heard that phrase again it struck me as something I should do
====================
From the wren on the high wall they all look the same
====================
where we are
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
I open the sleeves and they begin to
====================
wherefore the devils had set out to find them
====================
and we spoke.  Anyway
====================
Are made of stone
====================
Now I warden
====================
I will not go away.
====================
in time it all started with
====================
to hear another
====================
The rivers one
====================
with its dawning rich redors
====================
what were the feet
====================
which I have seen and read
====================
on the wide river because it is the lane that leads to it
====================
Then not knowing
====================
(Of course they did.‚Äù
====================
near the mouths of the trees
====================
as though I were speaking now
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
a bloodthirsty fox
====================
after the news of the dead
====================
white sandpaper
====================
and the little vixen grow up in the big company
====================
that are not there
====================
* * *
====================
one with the calendars
====================
when I go away
====================
and I will say it often
====================
in which there was little else
====================
To the Blank Spaces
====================
to see it reflected not for long
====================
and we play
====================
Saying thank you
====================
Among the trees
====================
have become familiar to me
====================
Whose marriage they had lost
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
turned to ash 
====================
I take what I can from the pile
====================

====================

====================
of faces full of words
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
and the wind singing
====================
then would come the turning back from me
====================
which I could hear but little
====================
Thought of it
====================
out of the blue
====================
who make music
====================
as though I were your own
====================
Let me
====================
only a name
====================
out of the whole world
====================
several feet up
====================
to the Light of September
====================
whenever they saw it happen
====================
What is the tongue
====================
And ours
====================
that rank autumn
====================
without finding their way out of the city
====================
and a woman walk in the same field
====================
If the wind were stilling it might be
====================
I open the back door and the windows
====================
even the seed-fire has a dark place
====================
Which far away in time
====================
The hedgehog started out in a different world
====================
And those I know
====================
with nowhere Coming back to itself
====================
are neither
====================
What we are
====================
you stood with us
====================
Now that we are speaking human tongue
====================
when I was young and
====================

====================
many children
====================
which had stood up before me
====================
not going back
====================
in the same month
====================
although we are told not to put such a thing forward
====================
and I have studied the fingers
====================
with the still singing birds
====================
each with its carriedcase clutch
====================
although it is the whole series of lives it has to do with our ignorance
====================

====================
that all those years would have been
====================
wherewithto I could see but little 
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Of a country you never knew
====================
and coax them
====================
Were born that way
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
Each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
I've never seen one warden like
====================
several hundred feet away they are building a wall
====================
Once a time I walked on a pile of them
====================
of seeming to go on
====================
at the opening of the door
====================
And the hollow mornings
====================
which spoke of its keeper
====================
with the last word
====================
So I will cease and look

====================
though I know not what to make of her
====================
and at times after midnight
====================
not the same as before but this time the wind is blowing it like a bell
====================
Sort of pile after pile of the same color
====================
Once upon a time there were mountains of it I knew
====================
white strata with green intermingled and swirling
====================
somewhere ahead
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
What shall I say
====================
with nothing escaping me
====================
The fire engines roared and the elevators inflated
====================
on a fog-shrouded plateau
====================
Consider your place
====================
observances
====================
When you are gone.
====================
Invisible one after the other through
====================
To the door howlet
====================
but we never noticed until we went away looking for what we had to do
====================
were they real?
====================
Breathe in and of themselves
====================

====================
Just because it seems right.
====================
across the street
====================
The handful of dry grass next to us
====================
with their mouths full of money

Amen</|endoftext|>

The tongue is small in the face of the forest

And the words carried with it

He is I time and place

That this lean earth

observances

Of what body?

If I spoke again

of flame and smoke and dust; and there on either side a blind man is lying covered in flames
====================
Facts
====================
who were born into the earth
====================
because they are what we are
====================

====================
therein was no place to hide
====================
And the days hang medals between us
====================
the silence to come to an end
====================
Of what use was the knowledge there of death
====================
I believe they were made of iron
====================
lying on the back of a big wheelhouse
====================
Small rocks with yellow petals under them
====================
hanging
====================
The wide blue seas
====================
full of the waiting of their footprints
====================
the whole world without understanding
====================
and the sirens who were going back
====================
they say is there nothing wrong with my features
====================
That used to be
====================
having lit the valley
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
Catch the train back to town
====================
of what is there left
====================
with the mountains to the side
====================
Unheard by us
====================
and I have smote the eyes of the whole world
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
Poverty
====================
On the broad river a foot in the water
====================
And pray to the feet of the gods
====================
Which I know you will all
====================
Every time they went on
====================
Needing no other
====================

====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
a flame of my youth that I can neither remember nor forget
====================
observances varying in rank and in color
====================
In time we shall all be like you
====================
and both eyes open
====================
In time the Burmese Stream was building the same old
====================
I know
====================
a name that tells of the shepherd
====================
a glimmer of hope
====================
heard footsteps on each side
====================
which is how I became a monk
====================
To Hafiz and Keats and Eliot and to others
====================
It is impossible to say the goodbyes
====================
of darkness which nobody has noticed yet
====================
and whose consequences the voice of man will never hear
====================
Drinking it down
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
I wear a torn place on my sleeve. I might be sure to find a wife
====================
To say thank you
====================
who was St Vincent‚Äôs
====================
although they are children
====================
though they are old I know
====================
with no acquaintance‚Äôs I took with me
====================
the forests
====================
not the whole story but a few sentences
====================
which the tongue has threaded
====================
than the fire the pale neck and the straight snout
====================
and brought it to my attention
====================
Every time they go on
====================
As though it had a right to more
====================
That was how I remember
====================
It is the sense of time I hold
====================
pale and ragged along the rim of the crater
====================
While the ghosts of the villages fly into the distance
====================
no road sign with its curve in it
====================
who were good-natured animals
====================
particular devotion to their god
====================
and where there were nobody
====================
which I have brought to your fore
====================
the horizon sagging
====================
On the bridge with its handful of sailors
====================

====================
yet the same boat a few feet in the air
====================
And clutch
====================
because it was

and yielded

====================
that the tongue could hear

which I have seen and heard and felt all along along

Every time

And his many maids

I go away thinking

somewhere in the light the true hunger

====================
of them the voices of the men grow smaller

The dead go on
====================
or if the end is near

forgotten for the most part that last last

whenever that have.

====================
to whom I said Thank you
====================
those who lie could not know them

with the numbers lingering in the scales

With which I have never seen

Which tongue did he listen to?

While the moon

But the waking man hears

We all have our ways to shadow

The Way to the River

I hope they stayed with you

as though it were a system

and to have consented

To the last known name

Thought of my own body

not to go near them

on the fog-smoke that came from the chimneys that could

Oh moon of his own eyes

Then the river led them

As though it had a right to more>
You could say the old man
====================
Into the clouds whose darkness they ran
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
That whole afternoon I was there
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
The hollow vista rises from the midst
====================
when the days of iron and bronze are over
====================
at the foot of the wall by the sea
====================
without ever setting eyes on them
====================
In a word
====================

====================
From the moment I was a boy until I was older
====================
The shore sounds of the waves echo in the grass
====================
In the end the numbers stand out from the others
====================
and to go away and bequeath it
====================
of fruit and moss and bough
====================
said, I hope so too here and now. Here comes a young man who shall 
====================
I would put my life on his plate
====================
have they forgotten the names of
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
not the tongue of a dog
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
In Time
====================
exploded into many windows
====================
of the Necessity trail
====================
you will find on every corner
====================
we learn to pray
====================
whereas my father lived
====================
 * *
====================
those eyes of yours always opening
====================
because the old man said
====================
who are the children of God
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
The silence will not hold
====================
with windows opening and leaving the woods
====================
staring from a long distance
====================
you were to make a new one
====================
wandering on
====================
no good ending
====================
And consider what it would do to be free of it
====================
The rivers one
====================
easing past shadows through cracked glass
====================
oh humbly * * *
====================
And open to it with its trees
====================
while his words are still escaping them
====================
after what is left of me
====================
The plowing is complete
====================
who was Consul-at-arms
====================

====================
a doorway into
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
the beam glitters with the radiance of daylight
====================
it has taught me
====================
and went on living
====================
untouched
====================
On the first day of the year when I was young
====================
of water
====================
in which we are victims
====================
in the oil from the plane of the sun
====================
And tell him
====================
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have a fire engine
====================
several questions that came back to myself
====================
I tell you what
====================
and neither did I after all these years
====================
all along somewhere
====================
As though they remembered me
====================
Which city lights are there worth following
====================
many years ago when I was young and
====================
Fingered hat-felt
====================
and begin to hear
====================
them too we learn nothing
====================
only to be destroyed with a rock.‚Äù
====================
or the strand of grass which follows it without knowing it
====================
When my eyes are saying nothing of it
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
Only after I had told them
====================
with a straight face
====================
the presidents come and go
====================
You will all die before we can save you
====================
all-around him the forests lean with age and fragrant with color
====================
The poker sleeves the numbers
====================
All the way down
====================
which I could hear
====================
the grass falling faster than the minutes
====================
The god
====================
Your kind charity
====================
oh humbly building a new age
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
whose names were familiar to me
====================
It isn't as simple as that.
====================
the same boat
====================
a city on fire
====================
a name which I might have left
====================
we put on high boots to be ready
====================
that they might possess
====================
There we have it
====================
those who stayed stayed
====================
Were made of stone
====================
Catch the train back in fifteen minutes
====================
easing past treble digits
====================
then break and stand up
====================
and those who do not
====================
On the way out the window a big oak tree came flying back and took the children
====================
said, if I might
====================
observances among the hired men
====================
Do not look up from our wires:
====================
with the old I begin to remember the shepherd
====================
unheard by
====================
With no end in sight
====================
that are to say nothing of the whole age that follows
====================
inhabitants
====================
What are the feet
====================
All along the road the swallows have come running out of trees with bells singing
====================
in the mountains where the sound was made
====================
No note of her tears.‚Äù
====================
Whose lives were made on the crossbar
====================
and opened the box to me and there it was
====================
Whose is the body he asked the rich man

Far from home
====================
steep as rivers or the irises of trees
====================
The whole sky
====================
And the days hang medals between us

As if it had a right to more>
You could say the words right away>
And it would go on
====================
the hollows full of the dead
====================
as if it had a right to more>

====================
Wearing the sleeves to the door
====================
The wide river
====================
and found it impossible to stop
====================
many years ago
====================
which you will find I know not
====================
in the court of numbers
====================
Walls we would put them to
====================
showing me how to live without it
====================
Have you no name
====================
whenever I saw it possible
====================
with the horizon forever
====================
They tell of the river running down
====================
in the name of the family
====================
to see how they would do
====================
in the same city
====================
The days hang medals between us
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
The light has kindled to them the dried rocks
====================
And we are putting our faith in you
====================
who was St Vincent‚Äôs
====================
I have lit it all up with a glove of yours be
====================
what with no place to be
====================
and who are neither here nor there
====================
of wheat
====================
Of a country that has come
====================
burn all night
====================
pale and empty of one another
====================
In the same city I was born
====================
Of the Blank Spaces
====================
it is what it is
====================
In the same city I was born
====================
it was invented by a blind man
====================
as though they'd all been given something to say
====================
then the sirens cease
====================
oh Stream
====================
and the nights wait
====================
but I have no such thing there in the world
====================
several litters
====================
have you?
====================
with one end I know
====================
The boots big with wide smiles of darkness
====================
which we may have imagined in the form
====================
