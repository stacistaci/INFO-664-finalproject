What I want for Christmas
====================
a branch of the family tree
====================
that is the silence between us
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
as though I owned it
====================
oh God we can all agree
====================
Thinking of what I could do with the time I had
====================
there by the Stream of Friday
====================
to the city of wires and the bridges
====================
when we turned
====================
without saying a word’s
====================
He is how I have come to it. I know him
====================
where I have not seen you
====================
which are made up of smaller parts
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
And remember me
====================
What could be the nature of God
====================
Feeling it had to do with my hearing
====================
* * *
====================
 * *
====================
the rank skins warden-men and nurse and old man and footman—these were the names of the animals
====================
a forest of white marble
====================
and the raggedy water said: 
====================

====================
And the tears the criticisms
====================

====================
unheard by
====================

====================
To the hush of the morning
====================
Cries all afternoon.”
====================
easing after its eyes
====================
in the sweeping blue sky that morning
====================
While the hollows wave with their colors
====================
I know they all keep saying Come on over
====================
and we will go on without answering
====================
with the sidelining bars striking the ivy
====================
That was the whole story;
====================
The ash carry the smell of it
====================
all the way up to the high wall where there were no questions
====================
above the rainwater
====================
what are the feet
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
The swallows and the the theiling
====================
who live and breathe
====================
grows colder by the day
====================
something like a
====================
these days I go out and buy hay
====================
having deigned to clutch the other while I
====================
or as one would expect of someone who has followed no one
====================
To my father and me;
====================
whether it is from a feeling I have for you
====================
as though they could be sustained
====================
Saying thank you
====================
Whose name is that familiar voice
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
after whose hands I yielded
====================
I bring you along with me
====================
far from here
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
I step over the dust and the fire
====================
Walls of stone the names of
====================
and set out before night
====================

====================
To the wide sea of ash
====================
I may go on
====================
What is the tongue
====================
with names already carved into them
====================
The Way to the River
====================
with faces like those of ducks
====================
high notes of dust rising from the crevices of the paper
====================
Will I meet again
====================
of the same beautiful color
====================
[Needing no other]
====================
that we should humbly grant
====================
and we have seen
====================
Surprised that he had left it
====================
ancient rituals
====================
exploded into many windows
====================
were made of paper
====================
They all know the answer
====================
and on
====================
somewhere ahead
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
and made the day
====================
Might she think I had it?
====================
in time the lights went out
====================
The Doors
====================
that are to say unimportant in themselves
====================
still they go on
====================
Now what will happen to me
====================
when they turned to the last birds of the forest
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
for long journeys in the glimmer
====================
but it could not possibly be the light of day
====================
and the old man said Thank you, you old man
====================
Oh white rocks and trees
====================
The old man carried him home to himself
====================
and that we stood with hands
====================
Dearly as now
====================
Like a mirror over the whole world
====================
or inventors
====================
not to go past the time.
====================
Dearly we see her limbs
====================
of ether the tongue moving the numbers
====================
you have gone through with your voice
====================
and write what I can
====================
about to go away and’sire’
====================
all the way north through the country
====================
and gave him the ring
====================
<|startoftext|>
Except for one thing—you could be sure what that was like. Cable slipped off a ledge into the distance. He had seen Cable fall. Cable had heard Cable say something like that. Cable had forgotten what he had said. Cable had fallen. Cable had died. Cable had been given the name of a brother. He was Cable. He was Cable. Cable had lived. He was Cable. Cable had changed. Cable had taken what he had given with him. Cable had carved a new future for himself in the darkness of his own time. Cable had turned into a ghost. Cable had become a ghost of his own age. Cable had become a ghost of his own city. Cable had become a ghost of his own people. Cable had become a ghost of his own country. Cable had become a ghost of his own people. Cable had become a ghost of his own city. He had turned into a ghost of his own age in the flickering sunlight of another age. Cable had turned into
====================
and I say it will come to 
====================
it was
====================
said we were living in
====================
after which I return to the blank screen
====================
where there were no questions
====================
one after the other
====================
not because he was good to have
====================
Your standing ovation
====================
as though I had said something
====================
we play this game with words
====================
and this they all yielded up
====================
While no one is looking.
====================
In an hour or two the machines will be running out of the big poplars
====================
with the exception that time
====================
of the same day
====================
grows colder by the minute
====================
To-morrow I might as well go on waking
====================
Hearing
====================
them I listen
====================
you would think I had heard
====================
on the edge of the valley
====================
what if he did not move
====================
On a road through the mountains with a friend
====================
after those years when we were young and
====================
that was the end
====================
of their loves’
====================
Poverty
====================
Each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
as though they were still alive in full on the other end of the world
====================
somewhere in the daylight
====================
When the moon finds them
====================
were the words of the dead
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
Now that we are saying thank you
====================
with the seasons standing still
====================
Only in the late autumn and in the heat of autumn would my breath catch;
====================

====================
in the rocks one after the the others
====================
it came with me forever
====================
out of a music that I may have heard
====================
whether it be from the wind or the ray of a light
====================
Each white star
====================
All these years behind windows
====================
who go to church daily with no church attendance
====================
and for a time I was
====================
with no end in sight
====================
the shadows of your eyes
====================
Bread
====================
Though it befalls me
====================
as though it were a system
====================

====================
in the daylight
====================
If I die
====================
pumping oxygen to the old man
====================
at the end of the paper
====================
They said go away and listen to what I say
====================
even the mountains
====================
And my shadow where I could see
====================
of wisdom
====================
high note held without trembling
====================
that is to say, without comment as to who was telling the truth and now the blind man is speaking out
====================
those who walk on clouds of smoke
====================
When you are gone
====================
one of the sides of the boat
====================
of the world
====================
which you will find I have known you all
====================
whenever I went to the dark
====================
are gone before me
====================
then we will all go away laughing
====================
and comprehending it as if it were a language
====================
to each other first thing in the morning
====================
that night I was standing by the stream looking out
====================
Toward the End Of My Life
====================
To the Thumbs of Auks
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
In Time
====================
And when I went on writing it was already over
====================
were broken into small clippings
====================
and they explain that lightning struck the glass vessel
====================
in the same city
====================
To this day
====================
I ask you to become a father
====================
They would look beyond themselves
====================

====================
a life without the screen

====================
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man
====================
in the mornings when we were little
====================
as though it were my whole life as though it were still possible
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
I will say nothing of it
====================
still we might coax you with pebbles
====================
What a kindness to have a stranger help you with what you have got
====================
Jailed in himself
====================
of grass that did not stir
====================
The faces
====================
of numbers
====================
and through the house of the mapmaker
====================
For two hills
====================
Once again I beheld a voice coming from the back
====================
and warden_{|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>came along looking
====================
or at the same time I have come to ask what will
====================
who are we
====================
you stood at the open window
====================
And at last I see him
====================
I wear it as a badge of obedience
====================
which the old man said to her
====================
red beacons and trail were set out first among them and sat
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
with its gleaming cities
====================
in the same month
====================
observances in the fields
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
but the wind said
====================
On the road
====================
the blue sky
====================
But Cable said
====================
Whose ashen body they held
====================

====================
Which language are you speaking?
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
and carried away to earth
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
all the way north on the train the sun shining through the chill glass
====================
as though I recognized them all
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
For the Anniversary of My Death
====================
Invisible People
====================
The eyes of God
====================
But seeing that no one was listening nor escaping the sentence
====================
in the broad daylight
====================
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
====================
A word about eyes
====================
and brought him along
====================
that person died a young man
====================
who are parents to us
====================
which it had never seen
====================
it is a system
====================
all those years we have lived
====================
which is why I asked
====================
And I will find
====================
and kept secret from the wider invader
====================
The road to the stars is long and winding
====================
but at the same time I know that it is not possible
====================
that we might bow to you
====================
and consigned
====================
Every time he went on
====================
untouched
====================
as though they were still alive in full on that time when it was most brief
====================
to the boughs below us
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
It is there at hand
====================
in time for Christmas
====================
in the process’ I begin to know how I am to live’
====================
And the eloquence shall wave home
====================

====================
What if I made a star
====================
as though I were still alive to say the name and the tears came with it
====================
in another time
====================
oh Light we see
====================
the ketchup cans were stacked outside the door
====================
who are already among us
====================
as though they had known me all their lives
====================
You would think I would have noticed
====================
A hedgehog tiptoes on the water
====================
you could hear the scratch and flare
====================
those who had the heart to say thank you
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
Thinking of the ducks and the geese
====================
that they would learn to pray
====================
and we would do better to thank God first
====================
The baked goods vendor tips his hat to the jar-maker
====================
with the stars glinting in the cracked glass
====================
and the light warden held her up
====================
it escapes its pain
====================
and as we walked on we could hear faint but we were not there we came across a fox lying stretched on his back in the grass eating a fox's tail
====================
The pointless hour
====================
I took no note of it
====================
As if it had a right to more
====================
what did I do?
====================
Now putting my finger to my lips
====================
before the others I am telling them
====================
what a country it is to exist
====================
I don't know how to put it; it isn't as simple as that.
====================
Little Sis-at-e-Marr
====================
The hollow glisten of the moonlit valley
====================
oh Perdita
====================
or if they did not exist they were not there
====================
across the street from where I was born
====================
and lose it
====================
with them we are walking
====================
There were the children
====================
The sirens go on singing
====================
Fingered hat-felt
====================
You walk on hats
====================
of rain still fell that could be caught
====================
In the shoes of the delinquent
====================
because the one with the others
====================
There are the slates where the children play
====================
From where the wells were standing
====================
said to me
====================
Gray as the sea
====================
No I do not see
====================
the noses of the gods
====================
to each other
====================
and always the same thing
====================
The flags of the Romans
====================
one that never left the shore and never went away
====================
steep as needles
====================
Needing no other
====================
in our time
====================
and catch them all
====================
you whom I consider as your family
====================
Now
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
which are the glories of youth
====================
Catch wind as she went on
====================
That was my life
====================
It isn't as simple as that
====================
because it is what is left of it
====================
but we shall find out where we are in the future
====================
but I have no idea
====================
that it knew not what to make of me
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
with hands I could
====================
That there on Twelfth Street
====================
wandering on
====================
Now sibyl said
====================
have set foot on it I know not where
====================
weeds that are not
====================
oh hush go on
====================
And my litany of lies
====================
That made them but feet
====================
Was said Vanessa
====================
The river leads down with it
====================
the faces of the men
====================
and we might put an end to the pointless life
====================
and what they found out
====================
In the same city I was born
====================

====================
kept company at meals
====================
somewhere where we were born
====================
And its folds too small to comprehend
====================
And we will never go away
====================
without
====================
but a shadow of it falls into my eyes
====================
Sort of a wave of white water
====================
is said to have been carried away
====================
The fog is falling more perfectly still
====================
Of these yellow petals
====================
The things we will never do or say
====================
white stringently threaded through it
====================
No shade
====================
with full vision in my eyes
====================
which at times seemed small in the knowledge that the hour would come and go on until nothing was left
====================
Thinking of wells
====================
of trees high
====================
not meant to be
====================
not a moment too soon
====================
Have no names
====================
and carried on as though it had never happened
====================
for a little while
====================
with no end in sight
====================
but they are taken for granted
====================
even a part of me is sorry I did not see it coming
====================
That no man will take
====================
Gray lightning quivers from the tips of trees
====================
You are the design of the old
====================
to be sustained
====================
oh this is the valley where the unicorns have gone extinct
====================
What do they think I am
====================
in the black of the real estate market
====================
praising
====================
which endears me to no end
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
that it learn thereby
====================
It is a garment I have left
====================
after a while
====================
which I know you will say will change
====================
In those days I studied your soliloquies
====================
so I studied the horizon
====================
The turning-of-the-millenlet into a museum
====================
Gray as the sea
====================
the dark tunnels
====================
it is what it is
====================
If I might
====================
all the way north through the bay
====================
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
====================
Presenting them with consequences
====================
or the boat they were brought back from
====================
and their strange journeys.”
====================
in the mornings they would stir and toil
====================
The face of God
====================
that evening
====================
for example with what seems like forever
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
When I write they are
====================
And grieve for the victims
====================
the great bridge across
====================
with no thought
====================
the fire engines
====================
as though they had known me long before
====================
Like clouds over the whole sky
====================
which is how I was born
====================
And the whole night will go on thinking of all the ways to go away
====================
The road full of shadows
====================

====================
and the turning plains
====================
mummified for you
====================
so this is how I live
====================
to whom I said and who was he
====================
Are they my friends
====================
and for a time we drank
====================
as we went on
====================

====================
‘No note of her tears;‘They stayed with her
====================
that last third
====================
At times now from some margin of the day
====================
as though I were still alive I go on looking
====================
blown to life by the wind
====================
Then we were told never to put a fork in a fork
====================
with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================
Or by the Stream of Friday
====================
observances varying with the seasons
====================
whatever we did as children
====================
not what it used to be
====================
for once moved
====================
of them the beacons have never seen
====================
although the stories ranged from short
====================
that will. ಠ_
====================
To the word playwrights
====================
Sort of fruit, if you will
====================
and from there to the mountain
====================
said they are hiding in trees
====================
sensible police and soldiers
====================
somewhere ahead in time
====================
which we can all agree has been
====================
That the invisible lean
====================
Now turning to the far side
====================
in the impossible light they kept passing them
====================
Which wheels of death are they on
====================
No man their business it is the head
====================
which I have seen and forgotten
====================
to hear one man tell the story
====================
Where we have come with age
====================
in the forests
====================
I knelt before her in front of her to stop my footsteps
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
A life full of troubles
====================
invisible a strand of sky that ran on
====================
the fire engines
====================
without understanding or understanding
====================
and their bewilderment
====================
in the right places at the right times
====================
Walking in the numbers
====================
and we spoke neither the old nor the young
====================
as one with the numbers
====================

====================
of shadow and water were falling in and first thing in the morning they are all running out of the glass rooms
====================
no questions asked
====================
Once upon a time the old man standing there was eating
====================
and thereby learned a thing or two
====================
whether it be at home alone
====================
To the name of. Caesar
====================
without saying a word
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
which I know you will say
====================
without saying a word
====================
and I will uncover the dark
====================
piling up into the forests
====================
who was Thoth
====================
Small birds are heard and the flies away
====================
when I go out into the garden I see that it is a garden
====================
whenever I was a little boy
====================
thank you
====================

====================
Then go on
====================
The rain has fallen and the dew is drying
====================
If you would hearken.”
====================
there in the hollow
====================
weaving the forests with her iron footprints
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
for ever
====================
of swirling water
====================
those nights I remember
====================
when I was little they would have said
====================
after what is now
====================
With blind crosses sweeping the tables
====================
Come and be new to life
====================
for he had seen them all
====================
and one day I was playing with a boy
====================
of no note
====================
Among the flickering shadows
====================
So will this game
====================
and held that if he spoke any of it he was telling the truth
====================
not looking where I was coming
====================
the other day I caught sight of a fox trying to tail
====================
In time a stream of light bursts from its banks
====================
What if the whole world was a screen?
====================
for a time he kept coming back to hear me
====================
about the roomful
====================
with my whole face
To the door
And hearses whispering
====================
It could be.  Anyway, the fire engine started up just past the curb.
====================
That I know
====================
Of May the moon have climbed on her face
====================
grows colder and colder
====================
They push the paper away from my eyes
====================

====================
The silence to the last words
====================
several of them the helmets
====================
The consoling
====================
I know it could be saved
====================
of waterfalls
====================
Needing no other
====================
and the lightning has shown me
====================
the road full of shadow
====================
It is the bow that I have pointed
====================

====================
never what is said of him
====================
and from there he would return to them
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
[with the] breath[s] allowed I take it it is my life[|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my little world
====================
you who arrive with your numbers
====================
And make no note of it
====================
Whose hands are his papers
====================
a story where I was born
====================
Of water a footrace
====================
and at the bend in the road where there was no-one
====================
and she kept coming back to the same place
====================

====================
It sounds familiar to me
====================
where I was born
====================
praising father
====================
in the same city
====================
with the city sky
====================
If I spoke that evening
====================
after the names I could remember
====================
one after the other
====================
with mouths to feed
====================
with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>surprised at your silence
====================
The ivy has set out from the branches
====================
With voices down there
====================
Which feet they had left they had to go on walking
====================
they are the fabrications of the whole world
====================
they play that they are small children
====================
and forgive nothing
====================
When you are gone.
====================

====================
poverty
====================
It all started with the look on his eyes
====================
which I have seen and heard;
====================
or


====================
And the hollow mute river
====================
when they were over
====================
yet with them all the time
====================
then the notes of bells set out over the square
====================
pale in the daylight, their cells empty
====================
of them I see
====================
which are reflected not only in the lime-washed baskets but also in the cracked wooden boards as we walked on
====================
invisible before us
====================
and without understanding
====================
without comment
====================
that the tongue could understand
====================
what troubles me is that they all have yellow coins on them
====================
full of the waiting of their footprints
====================
yet with an opening
====================
without looking
====================
Presenting you with children
====================
That there should be a separate house
====================
we meet with
====================
that was the turning-point
====================
I have seen her smile on them
====================
lying in wait
====================
That is how I remember
====================
The sheep they let alone
====================
And I have answered that door-mocking song
====================
Wearing the sleeves of white knights
====================
having already broken out of the womb
====================
Like a paper lantern carried on a shoestring
====================
and I have seen her often now
====================
in the faces of the men
====================
Holy charity whether or not
====================
noting a handful held by the toes
====================
and then to the last of the sentences
====================
That stillness after the break between meals
====================
everywhere
====================
Set me beside
====================
whether we like it or not
====================
and he will say a word
====================
I know they are there they are all
====================
Hearing how it is dying
====================
It would have been quicker if she had stayed longer
====================
Without whom we could not exist
====================
who are the whole People
====================
With a straight face
====================
From the water to the tree
====================
So the crossing
====================
not my thing to cry|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
still it troubles me to breathe in
====================
And Cable would not hear
====================
Which are the accidents of our ways
====================
and which the eyes have not seen
====================
each face in itself’sensible to know how’s looking
====================
In time there was neither
====================
but we are not saying thank you
====================
you will hear me
====================
long after Hafiz and Keats had left them
====================
a strange odor that I will explain
====================
To the bewilderment of time
====================
for I see
====================

====================
Walls?
====================
that it knew how infatuated it had become with this painted woman
====================
and the nights disappear like bruises
====================
With no god
====================
appear to go on and on
====================
* * *
====================
in which I could listen
====================
Invisible before us
====================
in the womb
====================
without understanding
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
