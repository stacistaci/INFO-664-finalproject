whether the sky was high or not
====================
which is how I came to it
====================
and through the dry season
====================
a branch or branch of a tree
====================
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
====================
that was forever theirs
====================
Asking what I had to lose.
====================
felt it was the right color
====================
On a farm it is said to be a flourishing
====================
Was it the good old days when I had it
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
Now the road to wealth is getting longer
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
we never saw you
====================
having dreamed of waking
====================
above all else I push myself
====================
I believe so
====================
On a high note lay a fork in the floor
====================
of watercolour
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
after an interlude
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
Neither do I understand
====================
To the unconquerable sky
====================
and would not say a word
====================
and spoke those names as though they had a voice
====================
who are not to be confounded
====================
I would have guessed from the order in which they were put together. They were put together at dawn on the first day of the year when there were only a handful
====================
which I have seen and heard
====================
Far Company
====================
a funeral service
====================
On a dark road past the varying faces of boughs of grain
====================
that while they
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
though it be years
====================
and the children go away crying
====================
bodies clean and smooth skin
====================
in the chill mornings and in the thick of the autumn howling round the hollows and gliding through the hollow
====================
the wells have fallen in and have fallen in on
====================
What shall we say?”
====================
he rose to the occasion
====================
easing after the nosebleeds
====================
Small animals brought back for study
====================
which I know perfectly
====================
even the shade falls
====================
I have seen her play with the bells
====================
The Way to the River
====================
In a dream I escaped from the body of the god
====================
as though I were saying something
====================

====================
and we are talking a body
====================
after we had told the same story
====================
to bow to you
====================
And we are stopping for what we are used to
====================
it was made in the said year*
====================
out of charity
====================
from the following fruit that I possess
====================
and I know what I'm getting myself into
====================
the shadows of trees
====================
Was it the breath of the tree
====================
and after the eating order
====================
I possess the tongue
====================
I comprehend you all
====================
A lonely world
====================
I am the breath of life
====================
grows colder by the minute
====================
but it is not there I am too small
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
of dry grass hissing through the city
====================
having taught me
====================
Just because it fits
====================
Oh Blank Space
====================
were full of the shepherd
====================
Some animals
====================
and save them all;
====================
without taking away from us
====================
not hiding it
====================
of iron and bronze
====================
in the same time zone
====================
or
====================
which is to say
====================
Cable said
====================
on the wall they all knew
====================
in the lily pads
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
so I coaxed
====================
one after the other
====================
with the same sweeping motion
====================

====================
we would coax you with pebbles and onions and rub them in them
====================

====================
in between sustained by dark eyes
====================
And we all go away feeling smallerExcept for that other night
====================
they bring with them
====================
They were made of stone they had not the will to live up to
====================
with broad sleeves and a hat
====================
as though they could see.”
====================
hanging
====================
that mornings silence
====================
those words once said to me
====================
And the ghosts of the villages to the brink of the sea
====================

====================
the pavements are silent
====================

====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
without saying a word
====================
having set eyes on them all
====================
Holy Night
====================
we would have been hardly better off a generation ago
====================
of course not my bitches
====================
invisible before us
====================
and the blind step past by the broad river
====================
We must keep putting our faith in one another
====================
in a parked cab by the water
====================
In those days meals were a thing
====================
I possess it
====================
That leaves the hush
====================
to hear the scratch as far as the snout
====================
While the old men pretend not to know
====================
which he had copied and molded into a wooden box
====================
full of their paper money
====================
and it is they who are the long-awaited allies
====================
I know the design
====================
to be sustained through the night
====================
what I thought I had it
====================
Among the Cable Tales
====================
those years when he knew them as they are
====================
little star
====================
you will meet me
====================
full of the fabric of reality
====================
The yellow water features
====================
hanging
====================
Saying no more
====================
And
====================

====================
Which specimens will survive your hands
====================
I never imagined you
====================
as though they had known me already
====================
who was St Vincent’s
====================
To the stars
====================
whether it is at home with the children
====================
the building dust and water
====================
to bow before you
====================
in the sunlight clawing at their skin
====================
in the Last Climbing
====================

====================
For the Anniversary of My Death
====================
and my ignorance nor the will
====================
Walking on water
====================
If I knew I would

====================
said to have left it
====================
pumping oxygen to the fire
====================
oh Thumbs of white light
====================
heard stories over and over
====================
it will not be forgotten
====================
that were born out of nothingness
====================
with bells in the sky
====================

====================
the ragged tunnels
====================
Bread
====================
that they all possess; that is, they all possess the will to do so.”
====================
then they would say Come on over
====================
Once I heard a voice calling from the other
====================
a tender wound
====================
The line between a film and a song
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
With pale hands I push them through the halls of the city
====================
heard the hollow hum of the grain harbors
====================
each of us is a part of
====================
still its glimmering
====================
when I went away looking for what I had to do
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
I have imagined the men eating lean meat with little or no water
====================
What if I spoke my own tongue
====================
And forgive nothing
====================
a year ago
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
out of order
====================
That it learn thereby
====================
In Time
====================
When my mother was old she said
====================
and the voices of the men
====================
and begetting them to keep coming
====================
what is the tongue
====================
with the yellow beacons at their ends I could
====================
the high notes of notes
====================
not a word that escaped my attention
====================
grows colder;
====================
Cable said
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
whether it's kissing them or touching them
====================
pale now that they are old they are saying the name of the river
====================
to carry her away
====================
but to be a father
====================
which I have read and with
====================
yet each day with its bewilderment
====================

====================
several who had just seen turned into ducks
====================
that never were. They would go on building
====================
The Night of the Shirts
====================
Over and over they write in their own tongue
====================
and without that nobody would listen
====================
Your absence has gone through me
====================
that is to say}
whereas along the inner ring there is no such place Here Come Übwe from Here Come Übly
====================
And who are the good omen
====================
one that could be sustained
====================
grows colder by the minute
====================
Like a flame in the day
====================
and did not believe until after dark
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
you who have fallen into it
====================
observances
====================
what would be the last word
====================
As I went on
====================
one step ahead of me
====================
|sometimes
====================

====================
to the rank corpses of parents
====================
all these years later
====================
still he did not stir
====================
a straight upward motion
====================
is the word that tells of it
====================
Now that it is your age
====================
Oh pile of yellow cards like cells of a brain
====================
Hearing say
====================
were smaller in the field as we walked on
====================
But Cable said
====================
It will not escape.”
====================

====================
steep as trees
====================
mummified for millions of years
====================
in the ducks and the geese
====================
Which openings the swallows carry with them
====================
with no rank place to hide
====================
The one after the other
====================
somewhere in the light
====================
whose name was I born of
====================
invisible at the top of the stairs
====================
Once again I was there and once again I was leaving
====================
all along like a line of writing
====================
Your voice to me
====================
it is hardly credible
====================
Surprised and at ease
====================
in which the faces of the men
====================
long after the story has gone on
====================
Is a rank life
====================
whether ours or yours
====================
antedilised bronze;
====================
at the feet of my father
====================
Might as well have remembered it the beginning.

====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
oh sis
====================
Without whom nothing could have happened
====================
an indirect one
====================
of the binding binding
====================
on a dark morning in the late afternoon
====================
dripping leaves across the room
====================
and dealt them death by the hundred
====================
of the stone age
====================
I find myself at home
====================
Thinking of rain clouds that rose over us
====================
The rank young woman
====================
in the dark a cup of water that had come with it
====================
and with that he goes on
====================
With wires running through them
====================
as though I had known them all already
====================
Blessing be on you
====================
Though I see they are the same
====================
When you are gone.
====================
at its margin warmer than daylight
====================
Which I do not understand
====================
Your absence will not be long
====================
as though it had all happened a little differently. 
====================
what was that
====================
as though it had never happened
====================
have they forgotten the pale vixen
====================
Small animals kept for long journeys
====================
Holy Trinity
====================
In the light the whole world

a surface where the light once was

And we all humbly bow to you

Of old she will say

or at least the design was not to expect such a thing.

and uncover them

Winding along your inner mountains

he stood still

And so it will go on.”
