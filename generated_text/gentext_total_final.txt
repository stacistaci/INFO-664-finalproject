Without whom no human life could have gone on

Alone like a key in a lock

What my children I lost;

The hands reaching down
For telling the story

And you will find a tongue
as though I remembered it
Now
sometimes with a glint in the fading
invisible from the open eyes
They could wait
To the Sacred River
Drinking water
To this day

What was the fork called

whenever they saw it happen
hearing
the villages red with the animals
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
Are made of tears
a name
and we might all live to be older
Hearing
as though it were an old thing
that oh silence
a hope that would come to nothing
What can be said of a camel
It would be a blessing to have my name called
Now step by step we go
the flame is out

That the hollow Stream of Friday

Of broad plains the rocks hang

To the Light of September

but the passers-by seem less acquaintanceable
in the vast open sky
once in the same life
in the forests
I've had a long look at someone
Asking what shall I say
and this time it was the drunkard

you are familiar to me
who lives by the stream

That they have forgotten

Of how the wells were made

Came a fox to scratch the grass
to the oaks they were pasture
You could hear the scratch
in the forests the flashing lights
Then I will no longer

in those days we would find ourselves

Who are the compatriots

And the numbers the same

Whom I never knew
not recognising the features of the person
which I might have learned from
and if the lights go out and it isn't it it goes on
For it is what is dear to us
that they may know them better than from the things they say
Oh Blankom
we would all be dead
in the same city
And try again tomorrow
and the oysters and bells
And hang
that morning they assembled in the open courtyard
The margin of his shadow
in the forests
Doing what you are told to do
Far Company
I took a tin cup and climbed’salks’
To be a shepherd
He was old he is the fabric of the earth
and I have seen her often enough
then stood me looking up and down
as though I recognized them all
who go out into the world
The hands
I know the design
Alone like a key in a lock
But it is he who is the hedgehog
in other words what I am I ask you to do
in the sluiced water they said thank you
and with them his body
I've heard tales about mice and wolves
whose design was the exploitation of the earth
somewhere in the daylight
what if we could do the same
that has fallen into its own time; it’s
whether it be at home or with a friend
Whose is his weal
Your death ours
never the same never caught while through the small leaves
not in the old days when I was a boy
but it was Cable who first called
and I have seen her with old age
The flags of Germany

of its own accord
Except for the wind.”
Once again I was there and once again I was leaving
and the hollow echoing
What for
For Wendell Berry
in the hollow
particular shade would fall with the dying
out of a wisdom I never knew
the same vision over and over
whenever I went away like a light at the end of the rainbow
then Cable said to Thorgmich
what is it
in the Street
as though they were still alive in full
a green sky
the nights of despair
whether they be the eyes of a father
I suppose it was that I held
I go on looking
kept secret from the authorities
a river of blood the size of your foot
of everything else I've learned
That he would comprehend
I offer you my life
and never the same never the same
that are to say nothing of the Twenties
In the rain forests they saw everywhere men lying in wait
who lived the life of tales
with the difference in the color of his skin
who made the stars last
white birds flying like laundry
out of charity
and if you will excuse my voice
Small birds by the trees I hear
While you are sleeping
whenever we were that far away
you who are new to it
without the company of my friends
No note of her tears.”
in the day I studied
I could feel it in my tongue
whom I would have recognized’s voice
That the woods are his company
then from them I emerge;
and did not know him
observances were carried on without cease
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
The way to the river leads past the late
The forests have fallen in with the days of iron
I put the key between my fingers
somewhere in the light the true hunger
those nights I thought I had a future
the line grew longer
What are the hands
lying
as though I had recognized them all already
heard stories about the dark ponds
in the same city
They said thank you but never once to my voice
so it is I stand
in a straight line down the middle
everywhere
Brim over with water
whenever my father asked
Feeling It's worth it
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
You could almost hear the engine go on
out of the normal world
on a warm autumn's day
of thin air
that rank youth will not his
in the middle of afternoon
The hollow
The mountains it is the valleys its the turns of men's hands
with no note of their own
In another city
that they may be sustained
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
I lay my eyes on the sky
On the wide river
while I copied the same design
Men think they are better than grass
still he is a whale
in the same breath
The way to the river leads north through the ivy;
I know what I'd do without you
oh Perdita
each creature with its own set of eyes
and was listening
far from here
from the ring to the mouth of the cave
and certainly we are to believe that we are striking up a life
All night long
and we have held them with our hands
with no acquaintance
whether from their own free will
that they knew not what they were doing
Whose house will he find
The helmets the kibitzes
or whatever you had your hand in
that they may come to the remembrance of
What is the tongue
To the Last River
where the hollows are
whether by design
once upon a time I was travelling in a different time zone
The late
When I go on
who made the stars shine by their own star
He dreamed of waking up in the same day
Far from here
Of everything I have seen in the glass
I was the one to ask
in the fur or the feathers?
whether we like it or not it is perfectly fair
Which I have heard before;
mustard ketchup onions and relish
which were carved for animals
to each other and with
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
whether the old man is talking or not
what a warden the mice are about
although I can see nobody else does I
who come with them and did not advance past the turns that led them
Hearing
with the sleeves torn asunder and the faces painted in moss
what if
What is the tongue
when I turned
who are the whole families
that they are nothing if anything nearer to the true God
and the glories of antiquity
where the nights were few and the clouds the sky
the hollow
when they went on
No what are the feet
full of their ignorance
who write after the time
long after my own eyes
which were assembled without comment and without looking
Whose and
then they would not see
to the Light of September
untouched
in a field away
and said
Or the sound of my own voice
dripping leaves across the room
In a field away I can hear the warden saying
Whose is his is
Unheard by us
left foot on a rock in the water
somewhere in the light the true hunger
Are there trees whose branches have never seen them
While you are at it
where the seasons were not in the same month
With the seasons drawing to a close
And the days of iron rule us all
looking down at the tops of the trees
Feeling It's worth it
as a whole body part
a phrase I hear all the time
The gorges long live the bald heads
of Night Stream
long after the fashion of their age
Except in the last of the late
Nor the echo when I went on
where we came from
it is what it is
few wells stacked
out of the blue I hear a voice saying something to the effect
Every time.
(Like a mirror through the daylight
but have you
with no sign of how it might turn out
I thank you
Needing no other
with whom I spoke less and less often?
somewhere where we were born
with my whole life ahead of me
then the whispering birds
And the nails the wreaths of the earth
It seems from the moment I became aware that anyone
Walls of silence
said to have been made of it all
as though they were still children
were full of themselves and were about to go on
in the end there was nothing left
said to myself; they are the accidents of my ways
Which hair my eyes
many years ago while I was away
even today I can hardly believe what I am hearing
In the lily pads
them too I see
And its engine silent
on another day
What if we could
not a word they are learning to pray
whether from a selfish heart or from the will of the few
in time the voices of the men have fallen silent
I have seen him with eyes blue as fluttering as midnight
observances as shepherd sibyls
hanging mightily on my
to be sustained by its dark breath
a name
From eyes that were old they could see
you never noticed on the road
which escapes our comprehension
Far and rheumy with years
Now
when it came to me
That my word
Far Company
Now be here what shall I do
If only he knew how to nurse a baby boy
and buy a tin please tell me
and I had imagined you somewhere
with no house on it now and then
with no house on it part way out there
with them I step away from the chain of command
In the heat and lightning
It is a garment my feet are
Considering what you will of nothing’s will of it’s own life
I wear a torn place on my sleeve
From the star-crossed valleys
although they may be the marks of a long life
not my thing to cry;
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
without which my whole body was destroyed
in the folds
who are we to comprehend
That is the rank house
Far Company
Dutifully waiting
then we set out with our lives
And we learn that we are still
observances
and it troubles me that anyone would do it
a marriage of blood
Your wife
after one of the late lit fires
and after the names
At times they are everywhere
The names too small to remember
The plane came to a stop and the old man said 
as long as they stayed with me
Of shepherd stars
yet it escapes its chains
Jailed in himself
Loss of Consciousness
Cable said
that they all possess
in what is left of me
Thought of my own body
partly because it is what it is made of
and carry on walking
then to Ovid
still the process of dawning
Hearing
unheard by us
In the same city I was born
the way to the river leads past your single thought
then with a little charity I might have yielded
who is not himself?
They would say thank you;
And maintain it
And always the same: we are what we are told not to look\
Back at evening drunk with indecision and vices and vices
those who are older and who are not
and my mother
Will the wind hear me
What shall I say”?
after the name has forgotten and is sleeping
these have been offered me
have you heard of them
wandering on
somewhere in the light the true hunger
I know
To the Last Trees
We are old men milling about
And put off to the forests for a while
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
And Cable the Consolable
nothing at the time and now she
So long as I live
And from that hour on we learned to pray
of what might have been
I took my eyes
that is to say, stood there staring up at the sky
with no acquaintance
and a blind woman
in the twisted warden's garden
of countless names that had gone before us
with no house on it part way out there
Set me on a slope
the noise of the dead
With unquenchable hunger
they keep saying Come on over
and the future
Do not look where I am
invisible at the top of every
appears to me to be a thing I did not know when I was young
in the clouds
what a change the men have made
untouched
the scars on the wall
They say the story of Christmas is one of it
and a little bit too late for the day.
I would have thought that you would have turned out the way I did
which one of us has it
wandering on
oh Perdita
then rose again;
as though I were there and to see
I carry you
It is how I have come to it
as though it were a system
To the little villages
All these years he had imagined
but it escapes its attention
Once I heard the shepherdess say
I hope they learned little
Theirs not
in a box under them all
and the bells go on rising with them
The ghosts of the villages and the laymen
which we might have given
that evening he announced a funeral service
each shade of blue
whether real or imagined
You are familiar with the shapes and the numbers
they said thank you
mustard ketchup onions and relish
somewhere at last I recognize the sound of small children
in the hollow
where it was not there
The bewilderment with no end
in the field after sunrise
yet they all seem to be accomplishing the same thing
nothing at all
and spoke those beautiful birds
yet the moment will come to say a word
mummified for you
With him I am brother
and to hang upon it the stars
and one would be forgotten
crossing villages
where there were no questions
is that which we are told is right
long after the sun went down
all the way north on the train the long drifts
Your words make me whole.”
the days of tinny are over
in shadow
The church on the hill
where I was little the sight was
Every time it went on
that sleep
because they were made
and it escapes our attention
the same flame that set off the last of the bottles full of water
you will never see
I might escape it.
to be carried on our backs and in the pockets
And his wife at grieving
oh humbly you intermingle with the moon
then break not far from me
and shall not be
with the earth between their hands
with a dark eye
particular shade to each occasion
The lily pads are few
Come and be where you are
As long as I lived there were no more questions
What was that I asked what would
Get together and find their place in the world
Consider the intermingled meanings
That it learn thereby
bodies clean and smooth blue heads white crowns
with no acquaintance
Just waiting on the other hand
which are among those details
then break open the other and open the blindfolds
With the bells channelling thunder in the chill ground
weeds
Will the bleeding cease and the lamentations live on
you will not hear me
when I go out
The eyes started from my own
whether it be from the long lingering
and the harbors
And we see now what would be the fate of the family
Of late they have taught
I take them as granted as I can
out of charity
”When you are gone.”
Here comes the old woman
and did not hear
What is the tongue
and once again we were living where we were proud
To the Light of September
a trail to the stars
in the box on the top floor there were nooses in it
then he turned and started to walk
full of the waiting of their footprints
The mouths of the mice
which ranged for days over at half-full
even now my mother hears
one last time
They said to myself oh by the Stream of Friday
While the hearts of the dead rise above
we put them up for display
with no house on it there on the floor there was nothing
so that they might bequeath them
weeds
They said thank you but it comes at a time when we all have
in this color
And hush the dew is falling on the true city
pumping oxygen to the old woman
whether baked goods such as bells or stalks
The bells stop and the voices of the men grow smaller
several Ovid stories
Every time she took note
Hearing
and held him for
and
whenever I went to church
the ghosts of old times
and handed them over
If I were a human being
to hear step after step explain to him
Far Company
In the name of the unborn
you will never find
So I take it it is the head I am looking for
it was there at hand
a kind of humility that sees through the lies
and we all die
which are what I am
It is the turning of autumn in the country
One great god
as long as I looked
staring from the end of the world
and to bequeath him
a strand of sky that they knew as the
Surprised at your skin
that the tongue could hear
as though I owned it
the hedgerows
and I have seen
Are there forests to be found in the hills
For the one who loves you
and
that they never saw coming
From what I could tell the place was simply beyond her comprehension
So let me’sGoose’
not without risk
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
So at last I hear the doorbell ring
a year ago this year
somewhere in the light the true color
Which tongue did she hear warden
In a fox's fur
The way to the river leads past the late
those who were not
which were made of the few
And quench the thirst
near the mouth of the valley
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
the bewilderment of waking
and I have seen her with amazement
than with a hundred questions
you lay your hand on it
kept secret from the people
but they would all be dead before they could be heard
in the wrong places at the wrong time
whether as families
as though they had known me whole life
and set about building upon them
Was there anything I could do?
with the word going out like a sound system
yet we all know what to do
in a cab by the river one night
I'm learning
and we are stopping before them all
The hollow halls full of the dead
of what little liveliness
with them we are marching
somewhere in the light the true hunger
as if it had a right to more
turned pale and thundering and clanging outside
But the word
Hearing
Far Company
in that rainless summer that burned my hair as a seed
in Time
as though they had known me then
Oh creature of the forests
and the Animals
and held in their hands
you will find nothing among them but silence
whenever they saw it happening
many lives ago they might have paused for a moment to consider
you would believe that you were still alive
to be sustained
which it is I choose to live by
it is for the accidents
these footprints
to the door that it had open
and a Blank Night
and this time I answered they ranged
exploded into shapes
The hedgehog
to hear their troubles through to the
out of nowhere a beam of light telepathically guiding her
The hired man does not seem to see it
then said I
and the nights hang afterward in the unhappy memories
whenever that had been
and his wife as they grew old
for myself alone
where I have not been
Who are the compatriots
whether you like it or not
And the stars to his left
Nor the wind.”
an orphanage
as though I were saying something
and wait out there in the open
In Time
Invisible among us
you were already here
for a long time they said
oh Perdita
“Cable
We will not look back
those folds of white cloth
Which waking hours are as old as the stars
grows colder by the second
when I spoke those names again
Except when the sirens stop
Among the jaçanas and helmets the troops carried
You may think I am normal, it isn't real
Your absence has gone through me
The bewilderment with no end
all these years behind glass counters
I push past the counters
the whale calves or the black coat sharks had for hours forgotten
they said with a grain of salt
and yielded them all
with the mouths of their own
which falls into one of two hands
Sort of bandage my wounds
The blue sky ‘
Invisible Trees
Now let me nurse you
to hear the wind change and then return to itself
whether high, simple or rich, mute, vixen, mulatto or vixen
as if they had not noticed I moved closer
As a stone age knife you could smother your words
Hearing
and that through your silence we may be sustained in the morning
or without a name
The streets are made of paper
you could say without listening
You cannot hear me
and wait in the wings
in the hollow
of snowflakes that had fallen on high ground
When I go away thinking of the mice
that they are old they are putting away what they have left
Of what help was there
and we are still putting our faith in you
Now I know
few days after the dew
Of animals who are not
A story that I will tell
I took my eyes
The great koi
I will say one day
to hear your name said John
in the same month
Every time
of what uses
Over a long summer day
in the garden
the meanings of words
I've seen the building drift moonlit through geraniums
its white water features its drift
with the swirling leaves
in the wrong places at the wrong time
Bread
I carried her to the other side of the mountain
The knights hired men hired at bazaars to look
and we all learn from it
then back again;
as though they'd all been there
and ran
and the slates lie where their lives
and we go on
If you could see where we were going
as though I recognized something in them
It may be wondered at: our ignorance sometimes blinds us
Will never meet
and it is not there I am reduced to following
to learn how to live
then I go on
Neither my father nor my mother
What if they told the same story
and I have seen
Now I ask you to help me
yet another if
in the same year
The dead go on
as though they were still alive in full
in the dark
not the same as here
not knowing what to do
Be here what can we
and what were they
at the foot of the wall
partly because they are full
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
in the grass among them
Might as well get off of here
And there I stood
in the middle of the night
And the forgiveness of my sins
the rank sleep
One can only hope is that he will come to the rescue of the sheep
grows colder in the day
to the warden and the hedgehog
And the notes of bells rising out of it
arranged the corpses of animals
in the hollow
observances that were offered to me
of irises shining everywhere
with my whole life under their coat humping in the pans
In the name of the unborn
without ever noticing
many lives ago I stood singing
By the Stream of Friday
and we are sending you to The End
I was putting my eyes
with no house on it part way out there
Saying yes
which the same tongue has brought with him
on a string of stairs past the open window
Your absence has gone through me
in the first year after my father's death
far from here
of course it is not there at all
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
Of the whole world
Like wild animals on a broad unknown sea
the shadow of the tree growing past the wide open window
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
which the old man said to me
Among the long wooden crosses
which I have heard but a drift of
bodies clean
Unheard by
you were long past
The mountains of old white men
that is the whole story
And pretend to be something other
long after they had forgotten
then each day grew longer
those mountains rising out of them
Of all the seasons to come when there are so many
The pavements are clean
Once we had forgotten the past
after
you will find no man
an echo of the whole night
you looked at each other with your wide smiles
a warmer day
poverty
only when I went looking for it
of the whole night
that this strange place
with slits in the thin sleeves that can be slipped between the
when I go on
Like what your father had been
who was St Vincent’s
St Vincent’s
Star
for long after they have forgotten
a single strand of sky
Every time she waked
It seems from the day
where there were no questions
to the last echo
the seed heads of the sage
that they will not hear
with the birds chirping
where there were no questions
which the eyes did not see
In Time
each other with no man
in the head what is the whole body
Toward the feet of his father
that were older and with a sense of a wider future
By the Stream of Friday
and we possess with silent vulnerability
the footprints along the floor
Might it please himself to be outside?
It took me a while to catch on
red with life and with the turning turns that come with it—
and visited it at Christmas and New Year
but as I went on I came across
Whose is the kingdom
Of whose I have spoken
in the matter of an hour
In the clouds
were they real they no longer
thank you
Now humbly follow me
Hiding behind my own
all the while running
and I learned with much patience
To the hush of the morning
That dark
to the last moving body
With the rank hollows hollowing
in an old haystack
each with its own set of eyes
I've seen her smile on them all
One has to look past the scars to be a person
who was all‑around decent
where we have come with our age
grows colder by the day
Of your hopes
with the gaps in the
no note of the light
I could feel it in my skin as though I were touching a stone
and I believe it is what is waiting for me
after the names have been forgotten
but the days of iron
crossing
and it escapes into the verns
in the heat that morning and there was
not to be ashamed of it
you will find it not strange and empty
but those who have not are gone
without setting eyes on them, nor hearing the cry for help
long ago one of them went down to the open river to wait
And his wife at grieving
whenever I went away that time
that we might stand by and wait
at this very moment when
poverty
For years he lay warden-crow
And a voice said somewhere
you are already dead
which I could say
I lay my eyes on the sky
Into the empty bottles
They carried him on his dark days
have you?
that they might learn to pray
In the dark
when they rang and when
with green branch petals
when they had made a new acquaintance
It took me a while to come to terms with
Which chokes and glitters but
whenever the time
It is what it is
What is the tongue
and
with the help of a clutch of white-haired oaks
Hearing
Let us say what shall we say
oh Perdita
so a fire engine might hear
The hedgehog bit the thin man in the back that came into his own
and I might coax him
staring from the end of the world
If you would consider
the ducks in the geysers
as though I had a right to it
and spoke those last three
few words that might bring home a few words
whenever I went or just about went on.”
to the names that were left
in the dew
I was sorry to hear the old man say
that whole summer gone by
With trembling hands
The way to the river leads past your sister’s pale face
The size of an empty house
and they exist like families
that is to say, all the way down
a real noise
Somewhere ahead in time
in the ring where I could see
you will find by the water
that the tongue could comprehend
and the hours go by without noticing
I go out and buy what I can
I would have thought you'd be speechless
although at times it was in the whole night
dripping leaves everywhere
What lies ahead
was an old man who was a good father
in the belief that they would one day be
the folds
each color’s face
that hour at night it was
whether it be in the rank motion of an ape tail
and we are sending you to hear
And have consigned yourself to his hands
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
That is the design of the future
oh sister
What I want for Christmas
a branch of the family tree
that is the silence between us
as though I were saying something
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
as though I owned it
oh God we can all agree
Thinking of what I could do with the time I had
there by the Stream of Friday
to the city of wires and the bridges
when we turned
without saying a word’s
He is how I have come to it. I know him
where I have not seen you
which are made up of smaller parts
staring from the end of the world
No note of her tears.”
And remember me
What could be the nature of God
Feeling it had to do with my hearing
a forest of white marble
and the raggedy water said: 
And the tears the criticisms
unheard by
To the hush of the morning
Cries all afternoon.”
easing after its eyes
in the sweeping blue sky that morning
While the hollows wave with their colors
I know they all keep saying Come on over
and we will go on without answering
with the sidelining bars striking the ivy
That was the whole story;
The ash carry the smell of it
all the way up to the high wall where there were no questions
above the rainwater
what are the feet
staring from the end of the world
The swallows and the the theiling
who live and breathe
grows colder by the day
something like a

having deigned to clutch the other while I
or as one would expect of someone who has followed no one
To my father and me;
whether it is from a feeling I have for you
as though they could be sustained
Saying thank you
Whose name is that familiar voice
with no house on it part way out there
after whose hands I yielded
I bring you along with me
far from here
as though it were a part of me
I step over the dust and the fire
Walls of stone the names of
and set out before night
To the wide sea of ash
I may go on
What is the tongue
with names already carved into them
The Way to the River
with faces like those of ducks
high notes of dust rising from the crevices of the paper
Will I meet again
of the same beautiful color
[Needing no other]

and we have seen
Surprised that he had left it
ancient rituals
exploded into many windows

They all know the answer
and on

and made the day
Might she think I had it?
in time the lights went out
The Doors
that are to say unimportant in themselves
still they go on
Now what will happen to me
when they turned to the last birds of the forest
staring from the end of the world
for long journeys in the glimmer
but it could not possibly be the light of day
and the old man said Thank you, you old man
Oh white rocks and trees
The old man carried him home to himself
and that we stood with hands
Dearly as now
Like a mirror over the whole world
or inventors
not to go past the time.
Dearly we see her limbs
of ether the tongue moving the numbers
you have gone through with your voice
and write what I can
about to go away and’sire’
all the way north through the country
and gave him the ring
and I say it will come to 
it was
said we were living in
after which I return to the blank screen
where there were no questions
one after the other
not because he was good to have
Your standing ovation
as though I had said something
we play this game with words
and this they all yielded up
While no one is looking.
with the exception that time
of the same day
grows colder by the minute
To-morrow I might as well go on waking
Hearing
them I listen
you would think I had heard
on the edge of the valley
what if he did not move
On a road through the mountains with a friend
after those years when we were young and
that was the end
of their loves’
Poverty
Each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
somewhere in the daylight
When the moon finds them
were the words of the dead
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
Now that we are saying thank you
with the seasons standing still
in the rocks one after the the others
it came with me forever
out of a music that I may have heard
whether it be from the wind or the ray of a light
Each white star
All these years behind windows
who go to church daily with no church attendance
and for a time I was
with no end in sight
the shadows of your eyes
Bread
Though it befalls me
as though it were a system
in the daylight
If I die
pumping oxygen to the old man
at the end of the paper
They said go away and listen to what I say
even the mountains
And my shadow where I could see
of wisdom
high note held without trembling
those who walk on clouds of smoke
When you are gone
one of the sides of the boat
of the world
which you will find I have known you all
whenever I went to the dark

then we will all go away laughing
and comprehending it as if it were a language
to each other first thing in the morning
that night I was standing by the stream looking out
Toward the End Of My Life
To the Thumbs of Auks
left foot on a rock in the water
In Time
And when I went on writing it was already over
were broken into small clippings
and they explain that lightning struck the glass vessel
in the same city
To this day
I ask you to become a father
They would look beyond themselves
a life without the screen
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man
in the mornings when we were little
as though it were my whole life as though it were still possible
No note of her tears.”
I will say nothing of it
still we might coax you with pebbles
What a kindness to have a stranger help you with what you have got
Jailed in himself
of grass that did not stir
The faces
of numbers
and through the house of the mapmaker
For two hills
Once again I beheld a voice coming from the back
and warden_{
came along looking
or at the same time I have come to ask what will
who are we
you stood at the open window
And at last I see him
I wear it as a badge of obedience
which the old man said to her
red beacons and trail were set out first among them and sat
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
where we have come with our age
with its gleaming cities
in the same month
observances in the fields
that the tongue could hear
but the wind said
On the road
the blue sky
But Cable said
Whose ashen body they held
Which language are you speaking?
somewhere in the light the true hunger
and carried away to earth
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
as though I recognized them all
with no acquaintance or understanding
For the Anniversary of My Death
Invisible People
The eyes of God
But seeing that no one was listening nor escaping the sentence
in the broad daylight
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
A word about eyes
and brought him along
that person died a young man
who are parents to us
which it had never seen
it is a system
all those years we have lived
which is why I asked
And I will find
and kept secret from the wider invader
The road to the stars is long and winding
but at the same time I know that it is not possible
that we might bow to you
and consigned
Every time he went on
untouched
to the boughs below us
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
It is there at hand
in time for Christmas
in the process’ I begin to know how I am to live’
And the eloquence shall wave home
What if I made a star
in another time
oh Light we see
the ketchup cans were stacked outside the door
who are already among us
as though they had known me all their lives
You would think I would have noticed
A hedgehog tiptoes on the water
you could hear the scratch and flare
those who had the heart to say thank you
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
Thinking of the ducks and the geese
that they would learn to pray
and we would do better to thank God first
The baked goods vendor tips his hat to the jar-maker
with the stars glinting in the cracked glass
and the light warden held her up
it escapes its pain
The pointless hour
I took no note of it
As if it had a right to more
what did I do?
Now putting my finger to my lips
before the others I am telling them
what a country it is to exist
I don't know how to put it; it isn't as simple as that.
Little Sis-at-e-Marr
The hollow glisten of the moonlit valley
oh Perdita
or if they did not exist they were not there
across the street from where I was born
and lose it
with them we are walking
There were the children
The sirens go on singing
Fingered hat-felt
You walk on hats
of rain still fell that could be caught
In the shoes of the delinquent
because the one with the others
There are the slates where the children play
From where the wells were standing

Gray as the sea
No I do not see
the noses of the gods
to each other
and always the same thing
The flags of the Romans
one that never left the shore and never went away
steep as needles
Needing no other
in our time
and catch them all
you whom I consider as your family
Now
with no acquaintance or understanding
which are the glories of youth
Catch wind as she went on
That was my life
It isn't as simple as that
because it is what is left of it
but we shall find out where we are in the future
but I have no idea
that it knew not what to make of me
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
somewhere ahead of me
with hands I could
That there on Twelfth Street
wandering on
Now sibyl said
have set foot on it I know not where
weeds that are not
oh hush go on
And my litany of lies
That made them but feet
Was said Vanessa
The river leads down with it
the faces of the men
and we might put an end to the pointless life
and what they found out
In the same city I was born
kept company at meals
somewhere where we were born
And its folds too small to comprehend
And we will never go away
without
but a shadow of it falls into my eyes
Sort of a wave of white water
is said to have been carried away
The fog is falling more perfectly still
Of these yellow petals
The things we will never do or say
white stringently threaded through it
No shade
with full vision in my eyes
Thinking of wells
of trees high
not meant to be
not a moment too soon
Have no names
and carried on as though it had never happened
for a little while
with no end in sight
but they are taken for granted
even a part of me is sorry I did not see it coming
That no man will take
Gray lightning quivers from the tips of trees
You are the design of the old
to be sustained
oh this is the valley where the unicorns have gone extinct
What do they think I am
in the black of the real estate market
praising
which endears me to no end
with no house on it part way out there
that it learn thereby
It is a garment I have left
after a while
which I know you will say will change
In those days I studied your soliloquies
so I studied the horizon
The turning-of-the-millenlet into a museum
Gray as the sea
the dark tunnels
it is what it is
If I might

The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
Presenting them with consequences
or the boat they were brought back from
and their strange journeys.”

The face of God
that evening
for example with what seems like forever
Thought of my own body
When I write they are
And grieve for the victims
the great bridge across
with no thought
the fire engines
as though they had known me long before
Like clouds over the whole sky
which is how I was born
And the whole night will go on thinking of all the ways to go away
The road full of shadows
and the turning plains
mummified for you
so this is how I live
to whom I said and who was he
Are they my friends
and for a time we drank
as we went on
‘No note of her tears;‘They stayed with her
that last third
At times now from some margin of the day
as though I were still alive I go on looking
blown to life by the wind
Then we were told never to put a fork in a fork
with no acquaintance
running among you guiding your footsteps
Or by the Stream of Friday
observances varying with the seasons
whatever we did as children
not what it used to be
for once moved
of them the beacons have never seen
although the stories ranged from short

Sort of fruit, if you will

That the invisible lean
Now turning to the far side
in the impossible light they kept passing them
Which wheels of death are they on
No man their business it is the head
which I have seen and forgotten
to hear one man tell the story
Where we have come with age
in the forests
I knelt before her in front of her to stop my footsteps
Winding along your inner mountains
A life full of troubles
invisible a strand of sky that ran on
the fire engines
without understanding or understanding
and their bewilderment
in the right places at the right times
Walking in the numbers
and we spoke neither the old nor the young
as one with the numbers
no questions asked
Once upon a time the old man standing there was eating
and thereby learned a thing or two
whether it be at home alone
To the name of. Caesar

those nights I remember
when I was little they would have said
after what is now
With blind crosses sweeping the tables
Come and be new to life

and one day I was playing with a boy
of no note
Among the flickering shadows
So will this game

the other day I caught sight of a fox trying to tail
In time a stream of light bursts from its banks
What if the whole world was a screen?

about the roomful
with my whole face
To the door
And hearses whispering
It could be.  Anyway, the fire engine started up just past the curb.

Of May the moon have climbed on her face

the road full of shadow

And my little world

And make no note of it
Whose hands are his papers
a story where I was born
Of water a footrace
and at the bend in the road where there was no-one
and she kept coming back to the same place
It sounds familiar to me
where I was born
praising father
in the same city
with the city sky
If I spoke that evening
after the names I could remember
one after the other
with mouths to feed
with no acquaintance
surprised at your silence
The ivy has set out from the branches
With voices down there
Which feet they had left they had to go on walking
they are the fabrications of the whole world
they play that they are small children

When you are gone.

It all started with the look on his eyes
which I have seen and heard;
or
And the hollow mute river
when they were over
yet with them all the time
then the notes of bells set out over the square
pale in the daylight, their cells empty
of them I see
invisible before us
and without understanding
without comment
that the tongue could understand
what troubles me is that they all have yellow coins on them
full of the waiting of their footprints
yet with an opening
without looking
Presenting you with children
That there should be a separate house
we meet with
that was the turning-point
I have seen her smile on them
lying in wait
That is how I remember
The sheep they let alone
And I have answered that door-mocking song
Wearing the sleeves of white knights
having already broken out of the womb
Like a paper lantern carried on a shoestring
and I have seen her often now
in the faces of the men
Holy charity whether or not
noting a handful held by the toes
and then to the last of the sentences
That stillness after the break between meals
everywhere
Set me beside
whether we like it or not
and he will say a word
I know they are there they are all
Hearing how it is dying
It would have been quicker if she had stayed longer
Without whom we could not exist
who are the whole People
With a straight face
From the water to the tree
So the crossing
not my thing to cry
still it troubles me to breathe in
And Cable would not hear
Which are the accidents of our ways
and which the eyes have not seen
each face in itself’sensible to know how’s looking

Small rocks with yellow petals under them

To say thank you

not the whole story but a few sentences
which the tongue has threaded

and brought it to my attention
Every time they go on
As though it had a right to more
That was how I remember
It is the sense of time I hold
pale and ragged along the rim of the crater
While the ghosts of the villages fly into the distance
no road sign with its curve in it
who were good-natured animals
particular devotion to their god
and where there were nobody
which I have brought to your fore
the horizon sagging
On the bridge with its handful of sailors
yet the same boat a few feet in the air
And clutch
because it was
and yielded
that the tongue could hear
which I have seen and heard and felt all along along
Every time
And his many maids
I go away thinking
somewhere in the light the true hunger

The dead go on
or if the end is near
forgotten for the most part that last last
whenever that have.

those who lie could not know them

With which I have never seen
Which tongue did he listen to?
While the moon
But the waking man hears
We all have our ways to shadow
The Way to the River
I hope they stayed with you
as though it were a system
and to have consented
To the last known name
Thought of my own body
not to go near them
on the fog-smoke that came from the chimneys that could
which were made of stone
Oh moon of his own eyes
Then the river led them
As though it had a right to more
You could say the old man
Into the clouds whose darkness they ran
staring from the end of the world
That whole afternoon I was there
Winding along your inner mountains
The hollow vista rises from the midst
when the days of iron and bronze are over
at the foot of the wall by the sea
without ever setting eyes on them
In a word
From the moment I was a boy until I was older
The shore sounds of the waves echo in the grass
In the end the numbers stand out from the others
and to go away and bequeath it

whereas my father lived
those eyes of yours always opening
because the old man said
who are the children of God
Feeling It's worth it
The silence will not hold
with windows opening and leaving the woods
staring from a long distance
you were to make a new one
wandering on
no good ending
And consider what it would do to be free of it
The rivers one

And open to it with its trees

And tell him

several questions that came back to myself
I tell you what
and neither did I after all these years
all along somewhere
As though they remembered me
Which city lights are there worth following

Fingered hat-felt
and begin to hear

only to be destroyed with a rock.”

Only after I had told them

The poker sleeves the numbers
All the way down

Whose lives were made on the crossbar

Whose is the body he asked the rich man
Far from home

The whole sky
And the days hang medals between us
As if it had a right to more
You could say the words right away
And it would go on
the hollows full of the dead

Wearing the sleeves to the door

They tell of the river running down
in the name of the family
to see how they would do

The days hang medals between us
at the foot of the wall

And we are putting our faith in you

Of a country that has come

Of the Blank Spaces

In the same city I was born
it was invented by a blind man

Long live the short life
you never knew you
where we have come with our age
our knowledge such as it is
and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible
Vixen
Comet of stillness princess of what is over
high note held without trembling without voice without sound
aura of complete darkness keeper of the kept secrets
of the destroyed stories the escaped dreams the sentences
never caught in words warden of where the river went
touch of its surface sibyl of the extinguished
window onto the hidden place and the other time
at the foot of the wall by the road patient without waiting
in the full moonlight of autumn at the hour when I was born
you no
I remember thinking to myself over and over
Or the same spot in the sky
Or the same moment in time
When I look back
It has been almost two years now
And we have not seen each other in a while
As far from each other as possible
And we have not even glanced at the sky
Or the features of the earth
That are our own
We are the color of everything
Our families
Our cities
Our forests
Our rocks and our lies
We are the color of everything
Our forests
Our strata
And our language
And our tongue
Call
Every time
The nights have been unusual in that they have varied
In years to come I hope she will say
Thanks
but she will say
Once and for all what will
Be
I ask you what shall I do
I go out into the garden to look for what I may
Need
Food for thought
And for feeling
How often have I wondered
What is the soul
A body that is not there
Is there a soul in it
That leaves the world
And its darkness
To the far side
And its chorus
And its song
A new age of music
Song of Three Smiles
Asking if you may
Start by
A few feet away I was standing
and he had given me
The graveyards
Full of the waiting of the dead
They kept saying Come with me
But I had no way of knowing where I was
And with that I turned south
And the road I kept on the wall
The gorges were guiding me
But the eyes started from my head
There are the branches of the cherry tree
In front of me they are building the empty
Ages I see them as though I were there
The houses in the distance
They are the old houses in the time of the mice
Little dead
Little house
On the roof
In a dream I returned to the land
A land full of days
I return to the day when the mice are gone
Little house
When I go away looking for what I have to do
I begin to recall the days when animals were small
The hollow chipped rocks on the sides of the wall
Like columns of smoke I listen
To the tinkling of the bells singing in the fields
And the tinkling of the waves building
The hollow valley below the sea
Like a river that has come to the surface
And gone before. Thirty years ago
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless
And foreordaining as stars
Our sacrifices
Join your word to theirs
Tell him
That it is we who are important
For the Anniversary of My Death
Every year without knowing it I have passed the day
When the last fires will wave to me
And the silence will set out
Tireless traveler
Like the beam of a lightless star
text
with the exception of a few words he is nothing
whisker or the wind is blowing the clouds
are falling silver bells
the voices of the men under the blankets
have they died a person
they are the voice of the people
I leave them
and go on living
where I am
In the North
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless
and foreordaining as stars
Our sacrifices
Join your word to theirs
Tell him
That it is we who are important
For the Anniversary of My Death
Every year without knowing it I have passed the day
When the last fires will wave to me
And the silence will set out
Tireless traveler
Like the beam of a lightless star
Land of the dead
Start of text this is how I live
Up here and simply
Others do otherwise
Maybe
Identity
When someone has it they are familiar
With a name
For whom
There is no such thing as right
Fair play
Neither the name nor the day goes on dying
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man
I have seen the man's wife
Free of the circle of men
And the invisible as the house of cards
In the evening he has healed the dead
Loss after loss has been like the light of a candle
Remains
Overhead the seasons rock
They are paper bells
Calling to nothing living
The possessors move everywhere under Death their star
start
And the bells go out in full force to the cities
England and Wales
Every time they play
With faces like those of a boy growing up
It isn't as simple as that
Winter will think back to your lit harvest
For which there is no help
Of eloquence will open its wings
When you are gone
But at this moment
When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye
And our only
Chance is bleeding from me
When my one chance is bleeding
For speaking either truth or comfort
I have no more tongue than a wound.
The Night of the Shirts
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
to breathe in your shapes to carry your numbers
to appear
what hearts
are moving toward their garments here
their days
what troubles beating between arms
The foxes are eating the heads of the mice
They are eating the corpses of the men
And the rich with their loot
And the passers-by opening their eyes
To each other first; then they break it up
And demand that we return
Like ducks in the water
They will become extinct
Like the sea cows that were the afternoon
And the waterboys and the centenarians
Will soon cease to be such animals
They will become extinct like the villages in the morning
The same film the same song
The same city
In a dream I returned to my father's farm
A green valley I hadwn for miles around
At times now from ear to ear
From window to window
I could hear the birds and the sounds of the machinery
I could make out the shapes and sizes
of persons moving through them
as though they had already noticed
and would have known
What the hell was going on
when I turned
Four feet up
Fingered hat-felt
fired from two different relays
One of them was running
Far Company
At the head of the line
The white knights were about to order
Five hundred and one
Five hundred and ninety-one
Which of my many incomprehensions
Did you bequeath me
In the boots
To look over the wall of the cave
And see That Comeback
Be here what lungs
Followed them Under the Leaf
The tongue that Feeds
The Blacks across the River
The Burnt Child
Is a Body
Four feet up
Of course he had to go along
And the tunnels to the
Home that morning was a strange one
And the hollow mornings a strange one
The clocks were carried on the crosses
Withmen at the windows
To each other first and foremost
And my God at the beginning of the morning
I kept saying thank you
Every time
It was the sound of me
On the dark river;
And the hiding place
For long after that same vision
I
In the same river
And another
One that approached with a seeming power
That was my left foot
And a long way to the door
To My Perinals Eyes
And ajar
And Morocco
With the same hollow voice
That came running down the stairs
for the forgiveness of your sins
here and now
as ever before in your own life
with no memory of the day
When you were little anything
was better than everything
now anything
is possible
with the future
holding on
I can hear the sound
now
it belongs to a more profound place
That you
come to consider
what you would do differently
you might say so
although it may be
that is the difference
between what you would do differently
and accepting it as it is
has set you free of the body
of dry blood the tongue carries
with it
ago I learned to pray
Forever
Nothing they will come to is real
Nor for long
Over the watercourses
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
Making a new twilight
Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead
Again again with its pointless sound
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed
The dead go away like bruises
The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands
Pain the horizon
Remains
Overhead the seasons rock
They are paper bells
Calling to nothing living
The possessors move everywhere under Death their star
Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows
Like thin flames with no light
They with no past
If I owned you
you would have been my whole family
and probably my entire youth
and probably my whole marriage
and probably my whole life
A Year on the Match
Matches
I have lit them all
Now that we are sending you to The End
That great god
Tell him
That we who follow you invented flame
And we have lit your days
With wreaths of tin
And with the prompting of our Creator
We have lit your calendars with our fingers
And our own calendars
With the sound of our voices
Connecting us
The nights we have long forgotten
We were the forests
Our names are Motown and Nineine Bluff
We were a small band of men
Who stood at the turnstiles
A
Hummel or whip or claw or claw or claw
whatever you had your hand in.
which was everything
we were told never to put
our faith in you
to bow to you humbly after all
because in the end there was nothing
else we could do
but not to believe in you
still we might coax you with pebbles
kept warm in the hand
or coins or the relics
of vanished animals
observances rituals
not binding upon you
who make no promises
we might do such things only
not to neglect you
and risk your disfavor

Winding along your inner mountains
Unheard by us
And find its way out
Leaving behind it the future
Dead
And ours
When you will not see again
The whale calves trying the light
Consider what you will find in the black garden
And its court
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless
And foreordaining as stars
Our sacrifices
Join your word to theirs
Tell him
That it is we who are important
For the Anniversary of My Death
Every year without knowing it I have passed the day
When the last fires will wave to me

about the princesses and the harbors and the escapes and the escapes
and the escapes with no trace of them
after the name has forgotten it and the light has forgotten
Everything that has gone on before was possible
when the powers that be said yes and with no
information the New Yorkers would offer
to the princesses and the harbors
and the hidden openings in the glass
to keep an eye on them
and to keep an eye on the knights and the minutes
and the minutes of the knights who entered the rooms
Here comes the invisible stranger
The man who has no name
Can we say the same for the princesses and the
purses and the windows and the escapes
Here comes the invisible stranger
The one with the wide world
Now
The other with the wide world[–]
That great god
All these years behind windows
Forerunner
Little dry death
That tree whose branches grew up in the most remote corner
And whose limbs were as long as a foot
And whose joints were as long as a grain of grass
And whose hearts were as old as the light
And whose names were as long as those
That tree
Which names were composed of countless words
And those who wrote them
There are the names of the noblest of those who knew them
And those who have forgotten them
As the seasons change
They are everywhere
In the morning they are everywhere strange and familiar
And the nights disappear like bruises
And the days hang medals between them
They are everywhere cool and steady
And the days hang medals between them
They are everywhere light and steady
Sort of like a hat game
Except the haters are different.
There is no music
Like a song about how long it takes
The sleeves of the hats getting broken.
The bridges are crumbling
The clouds are setting
The nights are getting longer and the days are getting
Long after my father had left
And lay claim to the fatigues
Of his days he is forgotten
In the time of the mapmaker
I yielded to his wishes
While he went on inventing new ways to tell tales
For the Dead
The calendars
Each year with the years
That were
The times have never forgotten
In the time of the mapmaker
I yielded to his wishes
While he went on inventing new ways to tell tales
For the Dead
The calendars
they will say when the cows are gone
that they have seen the world
And the bells of New York singing
Ash the heights the days of the dodgers
The Fogs of December
The Great Sleep
In Time
The Sleepers
Have no names
I have passed it I know
Oh Sleepy Hermit
Not a stranger to tales of drunks
Thinking of how we might all become farmers
He studied the sky
After the Stream of Friday
Low in the air
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man
I studied the shapes and sizes
Of the world as we knew it
In the time of the mapmaker
I imagined the earth growing up
In the same time zone
As far as the next meal
The blind man studied the sky
The look on my mother's face as she spoke made me sick to my eyes
And I have said that before
I will tell you the story
To the Consolations of Philosophy
Thank you but
It is hard to think of the good woman
Presenting you with children
Poverty
To the city of Babel
Three blocks away
In a dream I returned to the city
FoursidesTwo
One that had just ended
And the other one beginning
With the moon in the sky and the stars
In the same city I was born
And now the city
Is dead
And the fields the hills hollow
There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags
Of the earth and the stars
In the same city I was born
And now the city
Is dead
To the tarter
Be here what can we
Do for the dead the footsteps full of money
I offer you what I have my
Poverty
To the tarter
Be here what can we
Do for the dead
I offer you what I have my
Happiness
Every day grow old
Call to arms
Do for the dead
I offer you what I have my
Poverty
To the tarter
Be here what can we
Do for the dead
I offer you what I have
My wife and me
Every day grow old
Call to arms
Do for the dead
I offer you what I have my
Poverty
Every day grow old
In this amusing map of Istanbul I was born
In the same city I was born in
When I was young the forests were a distant memory
For a long time I thought they were forgotten
They are what we live with
The Hungarian line of mountains
I go on thinking about them
Poor thing is made of patience
Will not say a word
about me
After my death do not look up from my maps
I took them as a sign that I was living
That they are broken as the sea
The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed
The dead go away like bruises
The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands
The waves of the ocean spray the night
The cities decay into the sea
The sea cows are killed in the water
The children of the destroyed are destroyed
The so-called fathers are not the real families
They are a dying empire
Slave
You will find it in the seasons
That are standing in the street
Standing in doorways
And corner shops
And yes ends out of cafes
In streets full of drinkers
And in numbers at doorways
And at knotted doors
With no man on it
Needing no other
Saying no more
Needing no other
A brotherhood of blood
Far from home
Here comes the stranger from time to time
A stranger finding his own
Home
Here comes the stranger who has not lived
A stranger who has not heard
A familiar song
Here comes the stranger who has not seen
A blind man walks on on the ground
He is not there now
He is not looking where the eye is
Making a new beginning
And the names of the trees he kept telling me
And the days I thought I had left
I kept finding in the hollow
Of the silent river a rising star
That rose to the top of the wall and where the still
Water's dark bruises appear where the dark
Is a mark of the absence of time
I have imagined the green sky after the French
Troops coming and going
Their bells stalling
And then silence comes with the plate and I
Give what I can
Feeling It's worth it
For I see
What my votes the mice are accomplishing
And I know I'm free
This is how I live
Up here and simply
Others do otherwise
Maybe
Identity
When Hans Hofmann became a hedgehogend
When I went away looking for the house
I found it on a road through the mountains
A house built of stone and with windows
I could see it already
Half-mooned and half-crowned and with hinges
I could see it had left the frame
And the beam of the flashlight
Back in time
The sign of the cross
Remembering names to put in their own
Bodies
Small but the numbers
Start with the bellies reaching into the folds
And the touching of their faces
And the sound of their voices
One after the other
In time they were the same color
They took them everywhere
In time they were the same size
Smaller in the eye and bigger in the brain
And the seeing eye picking out
What were they I asked what were they
There are no marks on the map of my feet
I have assumed the form of a smaller body
But I have seen nothing of it
Poke the hollow sockets
Invisible to the present observer
Only after much reflection will I emerge from them
One dark morning I was walking on a field
A light-colored fox followed me
On a field of wheat field
A fox a strand of grass
Walking on wheat
A strand of grass behind me
A hedgehog followed me
On a road through the mountains
A fox stood watching me
On a road through the valleys
A hedgehog followed me
On a road through the heads
A fox stood watching me
On a road past the wrens
A hedgehog paused and paused
On the slope a hedgehog ran over the tall
posts on the slope
the faces of
Listen Up Here
You're escaping from me
I'll take you with my child
To the Eiffel Tower
In the hope that you might one day be
a brother to me
And an older man
The old man’s coat
That I lent
To the Iliad
The man who had it
For I have seen
The other day I saw a stranger eating a slice of bread
There were a great many
Among them all the face of the mountain
That is the old man’s coat
That I lent
To the Syrians the old man’s coat
That I have seen many times before
In the same city I was born
There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops
And the flags of the villages
Flags of the vanquished
Are the yellow beads of the stonecrops
Every time the coat came flying off
It was the last time for a turtleneck as I went
Between New Year's and New Year's
And a little while after Christmas when I was growing up
Old age
And a little while after New Year's when I was leaving from college
And a little while after New Year's when I was going
On this occasion I had a little
Gardaí are putting out
poverty
To the word salad
They are feeding the dogs
They are sweeping the floors
They are building the stairs
They are moving the corpses
To the dark side
Of who I am a stranger
When you are only a name
When I grow up
Like a whole Sunday of bells.
And the dead
The night will come when every word will
Call
When the moon rose from its own perch
it has followed that the stars of old
weren't there on the night when they were
great in the hand and few in the crowd
were there any still in the hand
and all the way down
to the black rock where the beatings were taking them
Noise
No sound
Which of my many incomprehensions
Did you bequeath me
In the shoes of indecision
come up behind me and go on ahead of me
explaining to me
Why did the men stop at the curb
and begin to push back against the wall
above which rose a raised floor
and a raised ceiling bottomed out on the other
top of the third wall with a raised floor
in the middle with a top floor
in the top row with the dark bust of Jack the Ripper
standing by the doorway looking out
Matches among the trees where I could see
What were they I asked what were they
but it was there I knew it was there
A house on wheels
A wooden box a jar of water
A jar full of water
A glass of water
One day while walking on the wall
There was a big man walking on the wall
looking around at me with his mouth agape
and a long way to the end
No what was the man eating
He said to the big man
You have to see this it’s an ape bring
the little boy bring the boy along
so he brought the boy along
a wooden plate he brought with him
and a handful of water bring me to where the boy was sleeping
and where the little boy was going
after the way
that evening he brought me to where the boy was sleeping
standing on the slope
The bell rang.
Windows Live Tile put up with rain without waking me
To my parents and my friends and my mother
And my father and my mother
When I was young and
There were so many places in the world I could hide
One day my father and I came to a city
A city full of children
What is it?
I asked
What is its name
When I think of food
When I say I like fast food
above all else
I consider myself lucky
When I buy food
for the little price of it
I buy it from scratch
Every time
it tastes of home
and the corners of the world
drive by and see
nothing else ever seems to happen
hard at the time and with no way out
there
There is nothing the matter with speech
Others clutch the remains
And lay the faces of the dead
Forever
Nothing they clutch
And lie still
As though it had a right to more
In the heat wave that followed the centenary celebrations
In the heat wave that followed the funeral pyramids
Into baskets they are being led
Back to their days
Back at the wheel
Alone like a key in a lock
Without what it takes to turn.
It is what it is made of.
The helmets the helmets
It is what it is made of
With whom I did not know
When I was a boy
You would think I would be as good as new
Every day
More fruit from the trees that do not see
start
Except for the briefest of snapshots.”
Their souls.
They would have fallen into their noose.
Toward the feet of his wife
Leaving her that country
And his body lying
In the rank hollow
Now Cable is carried
On the dark river;
Nor even a shadow
Followed him over.
On the wide river
Gray as the sea
Flags of white water
Are his company.
Bread
for Wendell Berry
Each face in the street is a slice of bread
wandering on
searching
somewhere in the light the true hunger
appears to be passing them by
they clutch
have they forgotten the pale caves
they dreamed of hiding in
I studied there
as though it were a tongue
of water that stood in it
there on either side of me they had all been
pumping oxygen to the lungs
in an oxygen tank
for hours on end
as though it were a system
of water that held it
and was standing out in the open
in the open country
then the river Sam
crossed the roomy returning
to the sound of it
I could feel it in my tongue
holding on
I could feel it in my tongue
staring down at each of our faces
one after the other
as though it were an order
I could feel it in my tongue
came a voice like a small bell singing
over and over the dark hall
And a wooden bed
start
Start of text
Now we can listen
And if you will excuse my voice
Saying no more
And silencing a people
That is how I came to be
A people whom I thought was peaceful
But when I went on believing in them
They are nothing if not broken
Glass windows and crevices
Call and none of it is there
Walking on glass objects in the dark
I could see them for a while
Then I saw that they were all made up
I asked what if
Each glass had its place
In the frame that was my age
And my age it was
The long standing joke among the Denim
Men think they are better than grass
We meet at the ankles of the sluiced rocks
In front of us is raining stone and glass
With no old friend forming in the hollows
startof
It is a pointless game of chance
And held all these days
On the dark dice
Which were raised not far away
And set before the assembled people
The names of the dead
Which were borne pale on the wicker
St Vincent’s
Among the pile of green trees
Where the blind led
Their footprints
Their bellies full of money
And their broken promises
They would do anything
To see that person
Reverend John’s
Every time he went on
Making notes in the cards
He died of patience
He left a message
Facing the end
This time he’s with the old man
Standing in doorways
He was the name that spoke
For the dead man walked onendof
Give it me
And forgive nothing
This is how we live
As one family
Our lives as one whole tree
Let us humbly go over and
We do this together
As one whole tree.
Let us pray
For the forgiveness of our sins
We are one family
When we are gone
We are still warmer than water
We are the color of our skin
We are the color of our nights
We are the color of our parents
We are the color of our dreams
We are the color of our hopes
We are the color of our troubles
We are the color of our troubles
Good People
From the kindness of my parents
I say thank you
but from the selfishness of my ancestors
I say thank you faster and faster
What are the feet? They are like a stone bedspread
Drastic as a tearfully lit candle
Burning incense
On many occasions when I was young and as old as the stars
I have imagined the blank faces of the men
Whom I did not recognize
I have imagined the breath taking in the garments
That I had imagined somewhere else
I have imagined the dark chokes of the factories
That have long since been reduced
To numbers
I have imagined their emptiness
By the hour when I may have counted
The days hang medals between them
I have held them all for long
But the day is short of present
As for the hangman the effective
Is there anything I can do?
It would be a better life than this.
Do not look up.”
The sky is falling
From the blue sky that is.”
The time has come
To their full they would become the true Burmese
Saving person after person
somewhere in the light the true Burmese
were born
in the same month
I have seen the black coffin
left the light at the end of the tunnel
And the white one on the way
Room after room asking how shall I live
still
I ask only
to pray for the dead
And to keep looking out for the long haul
until something big happened
That destroyed the morning
I knew it would come to this
On the Way back from the Party the Carpits Were Smiling
Hot dogs and peanuts
Every time
Something big was going on behind the wheels
And I remember the look on my father's face
He would say thank you
And my mother would say thank you
Be here after the wayside;
Now this is the door;
There should have been doors down the hall
The Thirty-Sellers
Three gentlemen
Walk on our hats;
There should have been clerks at the counters
On what days, for what seasons
What forests do they see
There on every table were stacked the tablesworn calendars
Men building on them
Architecture was built on it;
The rooms had columns and theers
Vertical rows of columns
With slits in the hinges
That ran along the sides of the room
With its many windows stood the gallery
With its high chairs stood the staff
In front of the gallery stood a wooden bed
That was made of iron and stone and had its window
On it stood a company of maids
Bread
for each of them
One woman
The blind men look out over the city
Making a new twilight
The camel has not seen the man he has seen
The camel has not recognized the man
The smoke rises and falls but the camel does not
Followed the woman but did not see her
Footsteps
Sharing the road
The black coat the sleeves the torn hats
The black hatches appear where the sleeves
were made
I uncover my face and then clutch
The black coat cries out in a voice
That which was my business
Made from black and gold and platinum
When the coat runs dry
The thieves who break into houses
Find where the thieves are
And rob the robbed of their valuables
The body of a brother found in a field
On the slope of the mountain
Three feet underendof
It sounds familiar.
It has been my whole life.
Nor have I noticed.
Nor have I noticed the way things have gone on.
What are the details?
What is the mind?
Everything that we are is gone now.
What are the details?
What are the feet
a. Nails to the door
What is the tongue
a. The black coat that fell off the wall
With sleeves trying to say something
What are the hands
a. Paid
No what are the hands
a. Climbing back down the museum wall
To their ancestors the extinct shrews that will
Have left a message
What is the silence
a. As though it had a right to more
Who are the compatriots
a. They make the stars of bone
Song of Three Smiles
Let me call a Sky Collar
Love
In December we took
No thought for the weather.
Whom now shall I thank
For this wealth of water?
Your heart loves harbors
Where I am a stranger.
What is sloth
a. You who are ashamed of it
Who make the shadows of their troubles disappear
In the process of their suffering they are made to feel
As though they had a right to know
Who is to be kept secret
And to whom
In the name of the Father I wait
For the day when I will see
The stars shining across the sky
I will the hour
Long after the old men have gone
To the far side of the mountain
To Tellis and the others
Will any come back will there be no one
 to hear you
On the door it says what to do to survive
But we were not born to survive
Only to live
The Way to the River
The way to the river leads past the names of
Ash the sleeves the wreaths of hinges
Through the song of the bandage vendor
when I was young it was
a big city but it
still remembers
the names at the ends of the stairs
Tell me
about what those were
a bridge over river where the water
crossed town
and the square in the distance
was the capital of the empire
then the sea led them
above the clouds
low to the hush of the morning
when they went on saying thank you
the rich gave back
when they went on saying thank you
the old ways
With no place like a place
in the time of the rich
who were the good men
and the killers the killers
who rose to their feet and said thank you
where we had come
in the footsteps over which we had goneend
you will find those who do not
followed them over
dark and groping
before I have time to think
Empty of you
Your light has set out
On a quest to find what is
in you
You who are new to the world
And new to the world of camels and goats
And the Asians who make up the world
Do not look up there: they are moving
In a plane of shadow
That is how I come to it
At the foot of the wall I see the body
Standing in the street I hear the building boom
And the sirens wailing
Now that the world is standing
On the door that I can see I have no more
Hiding
I turn and look again for what I am
A strange woman who has passed the time of letters
And the days of paper bags
And said Ahab: "Ask no such thing and expect nothing"
Save what?
Ask what the blind will say
When they are done
Be here or be away
Do they know nothing at all
They are saying thank you
Give what you can
And
Giving what you can
And
Giving what you can
But thank you
For everything
When you are gone
Be here what can we
Do for the dead the footsteps full of money
I offer you what I have my
Poverty
To the city of wires I have brought home a handful
Of water I walk slowly
In front of me they are building the empty
Ages I see them reflected not for long
Be here I am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands
There is plenty of sleep in the body
And plenty of food in the garden
And plenty of water in the well
It isn't as simple as that.
Winter will think back to your lit harvest
For which there is no help
Of eloquence will open its wings
When you are gone.
But at this moment
When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye
And my only
Chance is bleeding from me
When my one chance is bleeding
For speaking either truth or comfort
I have no more tongue than a wound.
The Night of the Shirts
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
to breathe in your shapes to carry your numbers
to appear
what hearts
are moving toward their garments here
their days
what troubles beating between arms
you look upward through
your name and the hour tells of you
you stood out among the crowds.
white knights with black coats and gorging on over
tireless ride through the blackened woods
full of the waiting of your feet but a word
before you turned green
and the late birds were gone
but the tapes of your dreams fresh from your fingers
you gave to the church at grieving
your first birthday and then
never a moment too soon
for we were children3
never waking we were old
and our last words
unknown to us
fire upon fire our age
whenever that had been
more solitary than single snowflakes
with nowhere to hide you
where we seemed to be nothing
what we were
shot across the bowels of our
machine-throb heard by the whole body
and seen by
Little Soul
There is the silence that is the end of it
And the hour is out of hand
And the clock is running out of the wall
There is the darkness that is the end of it
And the hour is ending
And the hour is calling
From far away in the mucky
Body of water
From here to the sea
The black water slide
Toward the feet of his father
Where his mother was born
There and then the mouthful was that filled
With its stranger animals
Toward the ankles of his father
The white water slide
Toward the ankles of his mother
The mouthful was that filled
With its stranger animals
Toward the feet of his father
The white water slide
Every day grew longer and the still afternoons
ripened the distance until the sun went down
across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees
it was the time of year when I was born and that evening
I went to see friends for the last time and I came back
after midnight along the road white with the moon
I was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me
the wide silent valley full of silver light
and there just at the corner of the land that I had
come back to so many times and now was leaving
at the foot of the wall built of pale stone I saw the body
stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen
just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen
no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass
nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished
I carried her home to bury her in the garden
in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left
and to stand afterward in the turning daylight
There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and
only by the room's size did I see
them I thought you were all words out of one language
tracks of the same creature
To the Consolations of Philosophy
Thank you but
not just at the moment
I know you will say
I have said that before
I know you have been
there all along somewhere
in another time zone
I studied once
those beautiful instructions
when I was young and
far from here
they seemed distant then
they seem distant now
from everything I remember
I hope they stayed with you
when the noose started to tighten
and you could say no more
and after wisdom
and the days of iron
the eyes started from your head
I know the words
Some good news for those saying so
‘Come up behind me and go on
Ahead of me and come up behind me and
With different keys clinking in the pockets
And still I do not move
Or the breath of the mouse
Or the note of the blower
The calendars
The lit meals from the tables
And the silence from the sky
With no voice
Going back
In the days of paper
And the quotes
When someone uses words
They are brief
They are not important
They are the fabric of the world
I have seen the man
Walk on our letters I can tell
And the name is familiar
It is the old man I know
Drags his eyes farther away
And his words the tears of the childrenend
and older men wear shoes
so one day a stranger makes a stone by the river
and finds it hard to breathe
still warmer than the morning sunlight
then the old man from before the flood
staring from the end of the world
Hearing
Back when we were small
We were still children
We are not the same as before
The shoes we are standing on
What is the old man
Going over the slides one after the the
Old man we are putting on the helmets
staring from the end of the world
A fire engine will arrive
at the scene of the tragedy
Witnesses will be brought to justice
The condemned man’s complete silence
followed the white-haired old man
and the black-haired old man
Will you excuse me?’
I have brought my camel’s for transport
as though they had followed
their fatherlands
in their days as gods
you would think they would have noticed
they do not
catch their attention
lyachee in the back yard
and clutch
ready to go home
to tell them about the ride
or from seeing the empty road
standing at the top of the hill
raising his voice
in a French speaking voice
There you have it
the stories about returning to their own land
or the journeys with their mothers
the men leaving the lane after the woman
exploring
the dark elevations
and the dark burrows
where the fall had gone on before
and where the shapes of the faces
had gone on before
They said
Far and rheumy with years
And
No note of her tears.”
But Cable said
Your hired man nor maid
Your dog nor shadow
Nor your ape to be led.”
He said
Once I heard someone say
That the hollow Stream of Friday
Is a rank place to lie;
And this word
Makes me sorry: have you
Thought of my own body
I was always good to?
The frame that was my devotion
And my blessing was
The straight bole whose limbs
Were long as stories—
Now
By the Stream of Friday
Might not remember me
Half tenderly.”
They let him nurse no worry;
Amen to your language
And your whole body with it
And the breath coming soon after
When you are gone.
But at this moment
When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye
But the sound of them getting old
And the kissing old
For a Coming Extinction
Gray whale
Now that we are sending you to The End
That great god
Tell him
That we who follow you invented forgiveness
And forgive nothing
I write as though you could understand
And I could say it
One must always pretend something
Among the dying
When you have left the seas nodding on their stalks
Empty of you
Tell him that we were made
On another day
The bewilderment will diminish like an echo
Winding along your inner
The moon landed on the valley
Its surface blue after a while but the light
I carry it with me everywhere
I go looking for what I'm looking
Where I'm running
Where I'm standing
Feeling It's worth it
For I see
What I was looking for
A certain older man
Walked with a straight face
And a certain sandy shore
Shakespeare would have been a young actor
starting out in a country that was
only a word to Hans who had learned
from those who had painted animals
only from hearing tales about them
without ever setting eyes on them
or from corpses with the lingering
light mute and deathly still forever
held fast in the fur or the feathers
hanging or lying on a table
and he had learned from others who had
whether it's the music he can hear it
whether it's the voice going down the street
Do you remember the old woman
sweet and kind and gentle
And the one
After the other I have gone through the night
Still the same old night
In the morning I had heard the woman say the same thing
And I have come to find that the night
Is over there is a road I can travel
Easily at your side
Thanks
Like a whole Sunday of the same animals
I was a stranger
When I was very young
No one had ever seen me
That was my youth
A French soldier came and stood
In front of him a wall of blood
Set a stone upon it
That it would learn from
Who were the French
A French
”
It is the emptiness that we are saying thank you
And the days of iron are gone
And the darkness that has come.
Now
It is how the great tales have been told
that we are saying and believing
Every time
The River of Bees
In the Time of the Bees
The story goes that a blind man saw the bees coming
And a blind woman heard the bees warning
To stay where you are
And follow the flying bees
Birds of a feather
The green lights
Start in the schools across the street
And the schools above us
Toward the feet of his mother
Leaving the hills his only
ature
With eyes that say Thank you
You
Always remember to put on your shoes
When you are done
Go down the aisle
When I go down there is nothing
Like a door that is opening and shutting
Once I saw a dove flap its tail
And a hedgehog clinking its dark neck
And a porcupine wagging its tail
And a black panther wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog clinking its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
Like a door that is opening and shutting
Once I saw a dove flap its tail
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
And a hedgehog wagging its dark neck
Like a door that is closing
When I think back to those nights
At Christmas and New Year the same old games
Have always been with them at Christmas and New Year
When I am done speaking I go away
And to church on Friday evening
OMG what would that have been
Do for the dead the footsteps full of money
I offer you what I have my
Poverty
To the city of wires I have brought home a handful
Of water I walk slowly
In front of me they are building the empty
Ages I see them reflected not for long
Be here I am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands
Have no names
I have passed it I know
Oh Necessity you with the face you with
All the faces
To Luck
In the cards and at the bend in the road
we never saw you
in the womb and in the crossfire
And go on living as a normal person
But you have no part in it
The orbits are flying apart
The seas are rising faster than the minutes
That country has come to be known as
Virginia
When you are a new age
brave Americans
And our questions
Our fears as Americans
whom we consider friends
We might explain better
How we are connected
When we are
We are the forest
When you are old
You have not seen me
In the same city I came
To the memorials
Before and since the days of paper
What letters were they written in
1158
Ages I have seen them in the form
They are the faces of the future
They are the banners of the
Windows
Windows up there in the sky
Which were the roof steps back then
And the window looking out over the garden
As though it had a right to more
Who are the compatriots
We are the way to the future
In a dream I put on a high moustache
Into a glass jar and into a glass cup
In a dream I took a wooden box
In a dream I climbed a wall
In a dream I passed the police
Sir
There are the dogs
There are the cats
There are the rabbits
There are the trees
My father said
Once to my sister again
And that was then
That was a long time ago
And my last thought
Was that my brother
The gray sky with the drift of morning
Like a line of paper.
Small numbers of children carried them to schools and home
Or to hospitals
And to hospitals sometimes days at a time
Between cabins and cabanas
On the one hand there were hospitals
In the streets after the breadwinck order
And after the hospitals the orders
Breakfast and afternoon
Then what are the fastings
and how often will they appear
To the last of the last
There are the fastings at midnight and again
And the orders made by police again
Five hundred and fifty and a half miles away
In another city they are still more complete
In this time I am not living there
I am a city of shadows
And the dark is my only possession
The night the world was going to end
when we heard those explosions not far away
and the voices of the men
ifting through the rubble
looking up step by step intoendof
And we were all made of glass
And our lives were made of nothing but glass
And our numbers grew with every word
Every comment we made
We might as well have invented bread
because it would have been simpler
without our voices telling the same story
Over and over we were told time and again
When a river chokes and the hour
Profit after the gain
The wealth of old Rome
Grows colder and the darkness drifts
One dark morning
I24*8*13
When I was very young
There is nothing like the feeling of my own body
lying on its side
blown-up and inviting
into a certain dejected look
which says a great deal
but the feeling goes on forever
And all the way down to the roots
winging like a cool red flag
And I've
He kept saying until tears started to dry
That it was not possible
To be where we were a short time
And a long way to the future
A better world
A brighter day than any moment ago
The night the world was going to end
when we heard those explosions not far away
and the loudspeakers telling us
about the vast fires on the backwater
consuming undisclosed remnants
and warning us over and over
to stay indoors and make no signals
you stood at the open window
the light of one candle back in the room
we put on high boots to be ready
for wherever we might have to go
and we got out the oysters and sat
at the small table feeding them
to each other first with the fork
then from our mouths to each other
until there were none and we stood up
and started to dance without music
I place the box on a shelf and push it down
holding the parcel slightly above the breath
high in the lungs
I place the box on a rock in the water
holding it for a while but does not
reach for it
the hand reaching down
to touch the smooth stone below
touch
the smooth stone above where the toes met
when the man who had brought the box to him
came back from the crossing with a big pile of money
I put on the big black hat
to be sure he had it
He brought it with him
To the Consolations of Philosophy
Philosophers have long held that there is nothing new about the ways
of the world; there is nothing new about the world
precociousness that leads straight from the door
To the Sacred Wells
In the Time of the Beesend
wandering on
searching
somewhere in the light the true hunger
appears to be passing them by
they clutch
have they forgotten the pale caves
they dreamed of hiding in
their own caves
full of the waiting of their footprints
hung with the hollow marks of their groping
full of their sleep and their hiding
have they forgotten the ragged tunnels
they dreamed of following in out of the light
to hear step after step
the heart of bread
to be sustained by its dark breath
and emerge
to find themselves alone
before a wheat field
raising its radiance to the moon
Far Company
At times now from some margin of the day
I can hear birds of another country
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
Saras
We had imagined him to be a normal man
He is not normal we are talking about a man who has left a legacy
that is a country
Now he has gone
To the far side.
To a small village
A people
That are today the present
They are the days of iron
The road to the future
Is a wall of bricks on the other side
And a brother wall of bricks on the other
The blind man came running
Half carried on his run he is
Dragging empty he is
An old man came along behind me
And started walking slowly
Followed him over
On the bank of the river
In the other direction
He stood still
Drinking water
Matches among the stones
That were once his house
Now his house
He who has never turned to charity
Died around the corner
As if he had a permanent place
In my life as a name
I gave my life for it
For the memory of the victims
If only
He could say no more
In remembrance of the victims
If only
He could live
In the moment
I had something to say
About you I have known you
Never a stranger to speech
In fact I had imagined you somewhere in the crowd
When I was young and with no other
You would have thought I would be of age
Just as I was young
When you were a boy and with
No older
The keys to the kingdom come with you.
To the city of wires I ask you to bring me.
The keeper of the vault leads me to the other side.
And to the hand of the courtier
Is at the head of the table there is little
But upon reaching the foot of the table
There is nothing wrong with the body
It is the course of the knee I am walking
This is how I live
Up here and simply
Others do otherwise.
Do you see how I have turned from a man
To the hand of the court
Again with the flow of his camel
Oh pile of white shirts who is on a string
Needing no other
Rising from the woodwork
To the hush of the morning
Falling faster and faster
On the dark slopes of the slope
The eyes started from my head
To the hush of the morning
On the dark slu
On a roof of glass by the water
Here I go: all the faces
All the voices rising like wings of a ghost
I believe in one thing only—
The power of speech
Is unholy in the power of its victims
Who are the same as red; in other words, who are there only
words
One by one the different audiences
Listen up; one word
Meet face to face; mouth to mouth
For a while they stood there laughing
And a while later they were talking
Around the same building in the same time
And a few feet away they were building on the other side
And a big screen screen playing them
In the same city on the same day
Here I go again and again and again
The night the world was at war
And the world was about to fire
The entire sky
There should have been warning lights in the sky
start
what is the tongue
a. The black coat that fell off the wall
with the star on it in the turning years
when I went away looking for what I had to do
I found that I was living where I was a stranger
but when I retraced my steps the familiar vision
turned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places
and the places where I had been a stranger appeared to me
to be where I had been at home called
mill by the stream Erecting a wall between them
Inches to the Bottom
Where I had been
a. Here I had been
a. Here I had lived
perfect in the smallness of my absence
And a distant place in the history of mankind
where we had come from as humanly possible
with which to begin
and so on and so on
until one day I was visited by a stranger who said
I had come to ask what he would do if I asked
The mouths of the mice to be
Caught in the Twins
When they are gone.
The white whale as black as the sea
And black as the full moon.
To the last of the digits
And the blank end.
The black coat that fell off the wall
With the exception of the few brief tears
I have known him since the days of iron
The iron curtain calls to me
From the womb to the eyes
And the to the ears and the nose
And from the womb to the ears and the nose
And from the mouth to the eyes
Three days long at the office
There is nothing the the ears the nose the hand
Knows
The whole world
From the womb to the eyes
And the to the mouths
And the to the noses
Three days long at the house of the mice
Windows will never go away
Windows will never be what it is
Will never be what it is
Will never be what it is
Beautiful waterfalls
Will never be what it is
Room after room asking how shall I live
One of the ends is made of streets
One of the bridges is made of bricks
The shadows step on the bridges
The water comes down from the rises
The fire engines roar behind the columns
The smoke rises from the engines
The smoke rises from the bridges the shadows
The fire engines go on rising
The clouds look down on us
They are not real we are not human
We are not shapes or numbers
We are not words
Let me call a man
To be clear I have not
Thought of my own body
I went to see friends
Aging they are
Presenting you with children
Granting you the eye of her needle
Standing in doorways
Little endearments
Like an old coat given away
It is the fabric of life
And the straight road that turns out empty
And the hands that push it
There is nothing wrong with my age now probably
It is the age-old mistrust that is damaging
The one constant
The other is the old one
That old man did not look where I was
A stranger who came to touch mine
On the last day of the year
Married again.
Before we could begin to explain ourselves
we were told to hide in closets
For fear they would find us
Funeral service
Followed him or ran away from
His wife or daughter-in-law
was present when she heard the sound
start
The boots big with wide smiles of darkness
Over the watercourses
Making a new country
There little hills just off
The Highway to Centre
The Shrewsbury Boys
Who was I
start whose voice was breaking
When I went away looking for what I had to do
I found that I had left a record of journeys
A message that could not be answered
In the Time of the Animals
Animals
The endless runs on the white bread
To the End of the World
When you are gone
From what country was that
Star
That returned people
When you were little
They said
Far and rheumy with years
And that same evening I came to the rescue
From what city was that star
startof
Like a calendar in one color.
With no star
Time after time became opaque and the lines.
Were long and thin and the color.
Gray and white and the sound of the voice
Is the sound of the voice
Hearing
Back when it took all day to come up
from the curving broad ponds on the plains
where the green-winged jaçanas ran on the lily pads
easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges
crossing villages silted in hollows
in the foothills
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
of red earth and its
talkers eating fruit under trees
turning a corner and catching
sight at last of inky forests far above
steep as faces
with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering
airy valleys opening out of themendof
we are told to pray
to the Lord
not once did he let go of my life
and never will
the light of morning
come back to me
when the nails are kissing the fingers
of old age
they are calling to me
although the sound is distant
I can hear it in the air
I know the voice
Is saying something
I have come to a decision
There should have been a way out
For example, a road sign
I-95
I-95W
I-95E
Walk on by us
In the twilight
When I grow older
You will never be the same
We will all die
When we are over
Now let me go
To the door
Your voice is falling faster than sound
The stairs leading down
Are stacked high
And stocked the rooms with the long
boats filled with food
From time to time
I see someone
Dressed in the gray coat
And the tie
I have left the house
Here I am
A stranger
Dressed in the white coat
And the tie
I have left the house
Here I am
A stranger
Surprised at the earth
And the sea of gold
I see how it is done
Here comes the other morning
When I was a boy
I remember the sound
Toward the feet of my father
Over the river it grieves
In the Stream of Friday
There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags
Of the extinct
Native Americans
The Asians Dying
In the Last Year
Before the age of the mapmaker
you would expect to find among the relics
of silver plating
on the flags of the extinct
And the irreplaceable promises made to them
By the Stream of Friday
When you will not see again
the extinct
Will not know you
Here lies the hunter
The invisible hand
somewhere in the light the true hunger
appears to be passing them by
They will not see you
where you will not see
where you will not
Call
start
There is nothing wrong with me
although I have noticed that the grass is getting greener
and the boards falling faster than the words
have noticed and it is getting warmer
now I know
What am I to do?
It seems that the noose has got to be finding a way
tight or it will try to push the other
back. Here is a man
To My Name is Strong 
Alone this world
Like a small house in the snow
With no manning or light
Here comes the old man
Tireless traveler
Like the beam of a lightless star
Here comes the old man with the name
And the old man without the name
He was old he is not real nothing is real
Nor the noise of death drawing water
We are the echo of the future
On the door it says what to do to survive
But we were not born to survive
Start of story
Far Company
At times now from some margin of the day
I can hear birds of another country
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
out of a music that I may have heard
once in a moment I appear to have
forgotten for the most part that full day
no sight of which I can remember now
though it must have been where my eyes were then
that knew it as the present while I thought
of somewhere else without noticing that
singing when it was there and still went on
whether or not I noticed now it falls
silent when I listen and leaves the day
and flies before it to be heard again
somewhere ahead when I have forgotten
For a Coming Extinction
Gray whale
Now that we are sending you to The End
That great god
Tell him
That we who follow you invented forgiveness
out of charity and with no place in it
you will hear from me
when you are older
you will see how little I matter
For example
When I was young
It was a time of waiting
For the right opportunity
To the future
That future is here
The future is here
That great city
That old temple
Where the wild children ran on the floor
And play fell into their hands
Abandoned
The memory of the dead
Receive the Spirit
Through the song of the bandage vendor
I lay your name by my voice
As I go
The way to the far side
Is wide open road
From house to house picking
Back when it might

It is a strange life
Though it lasted plenty
For the hollow places
For the faces of the ancestors
Who knew the forests
And the glimmering rocks
As though it had a right to more
Who are the compatriots
We are the way to the future
Like a strand of sky that can be seen
From the mouths of the fallen to the rising
Now
That city might rise again
From its forests to the rising

And his family
From the dukes of Normandy to the Bourbon families

In the same city she visited’s womb

when I went away looking for what I had to do
I found that I was living where I was a stranger
And an old woman who had given birth to a boy
who had been born into a family
That were not born
All the way north on the train the sun
followed me followed me all the way to the door
The old woman turned to me and said
Your face is very small
It is not a wound
It is not even a part of my mouth
I said thank you
but your voice is very small
It is not even a part of my mouth
I said thank you
but your tongue is very small
It is not even a part of my tongue
I said thank you
but your eyes are very small
It is not even a part of my eyes
I said thank you
but your feet are
She may be older than me
But I have noticed no difference since
In the mornings she is sleeping
Standing at the open window
She is not there in the same time zone
It is hard to think of the younger woman
In the same city she will become
The city of shadows
She will become the window dressing woman
Shakespeare would have been a young actor
starting out in a country that was
only a word to Hans who had learned
from those who had painted animals
only from hearing tales about them
without ever setting eyes on them
or from corpses with the lingering
light mute and deathly still forever
held fast in the fur or the feathers
hanging or lying on a table
and he had learned from others who had
arranged the corpses of animals
as though they were still alive in full
flight or on their way but this hedgehogend

When the bell rings and the waves arrive

of waterfalls that might have fallen through the silent
echoes that were there on nothing else on earth
and no knowledge of the world beyond the borders of
the stars that were shining in their own sky
nevertheless they play an important part
in understanding what is going on
and in understanding how
to see this another way
The Buddha said to Hans
Just as the moon finds its way back
from the upward turning to the left
and the vandals who have plundered their
moorlands and destroyed their
tracks the dark underbelly of the forest
with the turning-of-the-millen on my back
and the sound of my feet on them
after I'd waked and waked and turned
more or less certainly over time
that I'd known better than that
the road south by the pond
turned into a country
little Italy
Our belief in you has not waned along the road to the Cupid
We have come to the knowledge that of all the animals
Hearing the wren sing and the falling sounds
Of distant hills singing and the singing
Of wolves pack by pack the hour is up
The dew is running dry on the faces of the animals
I see them at the ends of the world
A sleeping creature it is sayings
The Danes had long been the forerunners
To the last of the digits
The exceptions are hard to find
In the hundreds where there are no more men
Whose cities are no longer the same
The extinct
Far Company
At times now from some margin of the day
I can hear birds of another country
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
out of a music that I may have heard
once in a moment I appear to have
forgotten for the most part that full day
no sight of which I can remember now
What if we could Live Here with It
It would open up a whole world
A world without the boxers
And clocks the sirens the bells
And the waves the bells
Free of the boxers I could be

Rain or shine
Winter will think back to your lit harvest
For which there is no help
Of eloquence will open your field
With its hedgerows and hedgerows
Long after Ovid’s story of Philomela
has gone out of fashion and into the open
dark hours of his life
he tells the true story of his first sexual encounter
and the night ends there
all smiles and all the morning
staring from the end of the world
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
And bowing not knowing to what
Fox Sleep
On a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago
in the past
when I think back to those nights
I may have been
a younger man who may or may not have been
a friend or accomplice who stayed with the men
and stayed
with them through the night
dark and empty and unfinished
This word is foreign to me
and I know it is not
not right now
but when I live to see the day
It is a long way to the city
To the Greek temple where I grew up
And the dedications
Of the dead
When you are gone
I will pick up the pace
and the black coat that was given me
when I was young and green and red and blue
I was young and green
And my own color
When you

Do not look up: the moon is out there in the hollow

The years are brief in the orbits of the stars
They go on looking up: the faint
early morning they are saying thank you
You have set me free of the body of the fallen god
You have made me what I am today
The orbits drift apart like a paper lantern
And the light goes on looking
Making a new twilight Do not look up: the
early morning they are saying thank you
Do not look up: I have given you nothing but contempt
for a living
But Asgore said

with my whole body weeps as we explain
Once upon a time I heard the shepherd say
and coaxed out of the wells
not the whole story but a brief description of what is going on
but the soul

There should be a prescribed floor
The black sea

Hearing
What shall I say?’s

Now I go away looking

And Asking God

And through the bars and the tomes
Sort of as the wind in the field

We spoke our own tongue

And each day with time

The way to the river leads past the late

And for what?

You will be called to a new age
but my design was never to meet

Will anyone listen?
Neither my father nor my mother

which tells of the world

You are the fabric of the earth
They said
not knowing the name
with eyes wide open and mouths full of money
and I find myself answering: There are too many of us
whiskering on into the short neck
Hearing

out of charity to my sister
with their corpses
Each carved and twisted name
I knelt before her in the doorway
Hearing not of anyone but themselves I turned to you
Now turning to the future

There with you

You will be old as the stars

Excepting the one thing

nothing at all
Asking them what they are doing

as though it were something very real to me
in the glimmering ponds

And

The binding has fallen in; it is time

Walking on the fields on rainy mornings
where we have come with the age
we never saw you
In the shoes of my father
the eyes started from your head
I've seen her on a number of occasions
as though it had never happened

although we cannot comprehend
Over their lives the incidents have gone through them

whenever we had the most tender needs
with no acquaintance or understanding

Winding along your inner mountains

a farm with its fields of wheat and passed the summer
although the color changed as the hour went on
I have studied your retinas
somewhere ahead

Like ducks in the time of the ducks
whenever they saw it happen
the numbers walk on our faces
not knowing what to do
which can only end when all the way out is past

Among the flames there is life
Of infinite kindness I grant you

Though I have not seen

Or from a city I knew
Let me call a friend
And say Thank you
For the names that are old
and we are saying thank you

not to touch them at all

I wear the whole day's wear
where we are a place of iron
who have died before me
which we might have learned by now
And one small one
Every time they turned away they saw
And all the way north through the morning
whisker on the paper without understanding
And sing of mute feet
Will the river lean in its banks
What kind of police will go door-to-door tracking down the fugitives
Will any come back will one
with no note of their own
Here comes the little creature
searching
over water that ran along it
in the shoes of the killed
whether it be at home, at the turn where I was born
hearing
in a parked cab by the sealed wall that led out past each of us
Some chalks ago
the white whale
when I went away looking
which leaves the door wide open
without changing
To the rank mountains white as the stars
when I go on
what if they could be made invisible
When I was young and with no older sister’s
and remembered him
that where I had gone
the nights I kept looking up
forgetting what they had just been through
Come and be company
whenever I could
to be made of paper
and offer up a handful
the long sleep
Now my dearest dearest dearest dearest dearest
Oh juggler
That it learn thereby
Holy charity.
Thanks
then he announced it and it went on
And the days hang medals between us
there is nothing beyond
Into baskets they are escaping they are
Will you excuse me
with

It is not his name who is calling
a sight to behold
no one has asked me this before

whatever it took to maintain its color.
that they are accomplishing what they are not accomplishing
many years ago
somewhere in the light the true hunger
that came with me and parked in the back
in the fall of the last of the last
only after we had imagined
and stood listening
Each waking moment he remembers
which have climbed into the hollows
to the rank and unshorn garments
As for the goats
In all the years we never knew
gaining the attention of the children
In the wide lane the cows come running
of waterfalls
to the door that it answered I open it and there are the tables
Whose ways were his own;
with varying plums
Like the day the late have given me
in the highlands of the
after I taught
And the days hang medals between us
they will turn to you
with its twisted stalks and its fallow
The moon
whether it is the old order of things or the wider world
Into the wrong night
what we were told to do about it
But Cable said
many lives ago they stood in the sunlight and peered out
with no excuse
and the hired hands
Oh bewilderment
The soundtracks to the operas
The cloud tops gale in the small; the hollow
Now we must go home
and that he who is old never appeared
and carried on as though it were a normal life
or
thank you
The warden said before we left
but they lie.
I am your name
Some say sleep is impossible
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
with the sun already in the leaves
are shining like stars through
invisible if they lasted
that morning
Feeling It's worth it
It is what it is
staring from the end of the world
Oh bewilderment
When I go on
several others
with the gaps in the
and without listening
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
that they might have remembered
and that the stars were above the clouds
you would expect from someone who lives
with their mouths full of food
Your absence has been felt through the whole night
then the warden said
While there were no longer the wild animals
beside
must have been there somewhere
that time that and for the dead
grows colder by the day
”Cable?”
And would do such a thing only
and there simply is
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have an incinerator
and I try to think of a good time
Dearly into the next morning
which they knew but a dark word for
those whose names were forgotten
The days of iron
As though it had a right to more
Poverty
Jailed in himself
Catch them all and carry on walking
that the tongue could understand
a tender wound
and it is not there I forget
Winding along your inner mountains
It came with me
Now for the bells.”
and it is not there I am not
far from here
piling up into the open sky
A rose petals
and we will do whatever it takes to stop you.
and the thread stayed where it was
invisible whether by the feathers or the tears
which is to say
Do you remember the cards that were dealt
Do better still.”
Once I heard the shepherd do the same
these tears speaking of you
you can hear me
as though it were my own body
Then I will no longer
you will find it at all hours
to be dealt among themselves
a name the river Sire
left foot on a rock in the water
said to my father
its notes shuffled after them
in a glass house
which are the uses I have
So I turned to the left
To the Blank Spaces
in numbers
everywhere in the house
And grant forgiveness
That each of you have been
Then the door will come in
with them we go on
crossing villages
to hear the wind carry them
The nurses come running after them
what a game
something as though it had happened without it
those who go before them.
What are the feet
The Stream of Friday
Thought of my own body
That they hear

before I had imagined you
Lily?
not looking where I was coming
You would think you were free from the body parts of extinct animals
What is the tongue
Every time they assembled and he spoke to them
with our faces we meet with
You cannot hear me
That was the whole story;
of the whole world
without speaking a word
Of those who go on dying poorly
you who arrive one after the other
in the starlight as though it were still alive in you
of water
as though I'd said it countless times before
where we have come with our age
and lay between them
in the same night
and risk falling under it
And who are the compatriots
A warm cup full of water
in the boat when we came back from a game of fifteen
Now look over there
and the moon finds itself alone
You see you have your own way
where my body was sight
easing past clouds of smoke into the extinguished
Loss of Light
of unfinished business
or just past the turnstiles that stood on either side
when I look back on the world
If she were alive I would have thought she was happy
the pavements are broken into into into smaller pieces
When I think back to those late nights
the radiance declined through
forgetting the names of the animals
and who would buy him a life of paper thin
somewhere ahead of me
with little comment
few who were present would have noticed
and the voices of the men
in the same month
I asked
no one hears
the echoing birds
Might I go back to sleep again?
no thought has been given to the populous
what to do
What will that I ask you
Came the small boat-men
that they were born with
which I know how to find
and those
long after the names ring with the echo
to hear step after step explain the stars
as though I had said that many times before
with the words going out like cells of a brain
in a field away
yet with a glint
Your names that were
and among them those beautiful
one is how the tongue sees it
and I found myself looking back on the lives
The numbers wait in the halls and the clouds
forgotten by many
Of what use are they to me
They said thank you but not to me
and told him
as though they'd all heard me
To
not understanding what they are doing
and we all humbly bow to you
which I may have invented
whether we like it or not it can hardly be said
a good man and maid
for the cross they offered
the young men and the women
about me they said
Of what use is the world
And the others to follow them
to see who it was
and the whale calves the great white
which after hearing
The dew was drying on them and there were few
Somewhere ahead of me
which are made up of them all
mustard ketchup onions and relish
after all the sacrifices
so I asked.
a name that tells of its age
when they are gone
the whole night long
when the cards rang
and the wind calls home the branches
Come and beaming
Your absence has gone through me
all along that dark neck
Hearing
Unheard by
blown-up neo-classic facades
across the lane from the hotel where I stayed
I see they are made
If anyone has said a word
which were made of stone and had fallen
whatever was left after the meal
in a parked cab by the sealed wall I could see it in the distance
full of the waiting of their feet
we went on saying thank you
whether green or red
They are the stalks that are undergrowth
I was born here
oh Stream where the boughs are
that they had heard but a shadow
It is how I have come to it
But I have seen you little green men
Toward the feet of my father
in the Twenties
and have broken it down into smaller blocks
Some passers-by had seen them when they went by the glass.
steep as branches
In a parked cab by the sealed wall I can see the faces
Which color were they from the beginning
And forgive nothing
where the shadows go
And always with the singing birds
They said thank you so much
as one stream of thought
in the forests
Of my youth as a child
I might as well go away and have a good time
when we are done
whether giddy with themselves
Of suffering
That are to say: anonymous. But nobody has noticed
a curve in the glass that led out of it
then go on
When I went away looking
And offered up as sacrifices
Among the singing bees
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have the heaters
With my whole life ahead of me
for fear they should be forgotten
What do you see
kept hidden in the shadows
a silent song of his
I bow my head and pray
with the last words
The pavements are broken glass
To the Blank Spaces
As we went on
and by the curve of his sister's neck
staring from the end of the world
Of sage and of iron and Grey cardinal
they said go away and write what you will
Now I know
in their wheat underarms
Unheard by us
you will find that wherever you are it is all the same

the wide open land
and set free of it
Among them I see them all turn to each other
Of whom I say not a word
Except at Christmas and New Year's when I have not seen You
but the wells were poorly lit and the animals huddled
when I listen
The children will cry out
and gave them to St Vincent’s Hospital in the name of all—
to the small garden where I was born

In the glass columns the eyes have seen

A lost cause
The glitters
whatever the case
Once I heard the scratch as they passed me
without recognising it at all
those dark feet
Will ever find itself
It is as though I were here
that it learn thereby
that the tongue could hear
but for a time he stayed
an old man with ailing limbs
left foot on a rock in the water
still we are told not to see them
even now the last leaves
The wheels turning green in the headlights
but the voice of the dead
The valley is wide and dry
in the columns the flames have gone on
Binding
the whispering birds
and the twelve ghosts ‑
oh Cable said
Asking what is my field
I would like for you to survive
Cable asked what it would take to get out of the home
who have they forgotten
I could hear the scratch and flare
and its nurses
with my whole body he took with him
Though I see him as though it were another time
Little hush
as far as the last word

I move them

somewhere ahead of me
and the night the shepherd hid he found her hiding in the branches
which has become my whole being
As we walked on
several of the windows looking out over the garden
who were as old as the horizon
across the room the hum was complete
with no acquaintance or understanding
as though I had known them all then
as we neared the end of the film there was a silence
in Time
in the middle of summer
of iridescent glass’
If it were true
the third day
What are the feet
whenever we might like;
of woods the color of dust
Every time he went on
those pale calves the size of a smallpony
without thinking of it
and would do anything to be closer to her
with an oh-so *slant in it
a hand in every eye
Then spat I the mouthful of water
of the fabrications that go with it
with the flashing of the little lights
Which I know I have left
whether young or old, rich or poor
Abandon yourself from the sight of me
where the wells were made
of silence as though it were still possible
Which spoke of her so
to see that it could all be turned over
although it be years
in Time
the flags of the past
Of a starlight chain gone through photosynthesised cells
To the glitters of morning
With birds chirping
in the wide open lakes
It will not escape.
Now go home to rest
I lay my heart
So my friends
where the sea cows were a running joke
To the hush of the morning
far away in time
I've seen him in the sleeves and boots
kept secret from the other;
you cannot help but believe that the Sacred Heart of
and brought with him
Dragged his scales and set them on him
I can hear the scratch and flare
in a film made of them
then it came to me
Now I know
Of far gone meanings
Among the gray woods
The words go on rising from the grave
which went on rising on the table
one that was to come
No note of her tears.”
If I were you
in the back of the cab by the hedge
I find myself looking back at the sky
with the night the true star of music
The limbs long
You would think so little of a thing
Which way was the church built
and a blind man she sat by the window looking out
while my father and my mother worked
and the days of iron
The orbits were still in them
There is nothing at all like a clean day at the office
Oh sky so vast
Neither my father nor my mother nor my father or her husband
left foot on a rock in the water
pumping oxygen to the old man
that they might be as long as they were
and carried on without looking back
Who are the children of God
full of the ride home
no thought given to age
we are calling a whole world to arms
bodies yellow in the daylight
Thought of my own body
to hear others humbly talking
invisible ray
Hearing
several feet up
with a big wave of my middle finger
The wires going in through the holes
and they are building a new world
and what is there to it?
what are the feet
so this word is
though they were older and smothered in darkness
Might it excuse me
The feathers went up like smoke
and taught me
It is not a name I understand
That whale
as the invisible sleeves on that mountain around
Somewhere where we were born
whether we like it or not,
and would say no more
which is how I have come to it

and they would break into smaller ones

The feathers of the owl raised its dark oaks
When I went away looking
for the Anniversary of My Death
The same old rain forest with the trees gone tomorrow
The dog-eat-dog age
with no house on it part way out there
what were the stairs
Far Company
which we have all learned over and over
whenever they were small but the men always stayed
flowing out of them
Among the hollows
staring down at each of our faces
The sleeves of the shirts getting soaked in the rain
I lay your name by my voice
The necklaces
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
with the engine running
On a road through the mountains
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
of the same river
that the tongue could hear
Here and now
And my only
Now to the end
several of the windows painted in the same shade
who make the notes of waking sentences
and we all started our days much earlier
When I went away looking for where I had come

Holy intercession; let no one do you any such thing
And the old man from before he had a chance to say a word
with a few notes of rank water
unheard by

observances for the dead
that are what they are
whenever the offer was.”

invisible before them
I can hear the scratch and flare
and the horizon grew smaller
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
oh by the Stream of Friday
of the same color
full of their air
who is tall as the sky
who are we
Which forests the stream heads have forgotten
looking up step by step into
And put on a hat and go
It is what it is
the pain has gone through me
with no acquaintance or understanding
And bow to the Almighty
and dealt the day over with equal ferocity
that started with the eye
in that same lane’s eyes
appears to be going on
although they would comprehend
in the Twenties
Who are the compatriots
as though it were a part of me
of things I knew very little at the time and now I know
which Ransom had left at Christmas
Now set eyes on me
No note of her tears.”
somewhere in the light the true hunger
on the dark figures

the color of blood

staring from the end of the world
with no acquaintance
running among you guiding your footsteps
without note or understanding
But it will not escape.”
yet without understanding
a new age
Inhabitants
in the twisted daylight
The wide river leads past our heads
Your starlight glitters with the tears of the
mustard ketchup onions and relish
Just after sunrise they had heard the snoring
A mirror to the other
those whom we consider as families
Winding along your inner mountains
Then no man nor creature could push him;
have they fallen in love with one another
and the years have gone by
in the last year
A swirling blue sky
a time and place
Just as I had imagined it to be there
where it is not there I do not see
and make a stone one at a time
The boat came to a stop on the bridge
we would all be dead before we had a chance to think
shadows over the ground
and that his name was
which his hired man nor maidservant
On the one hand I am a man of few words
The boat white with the moon
which is how I came to it
having thought it might be used
and the nights disappear like bruises
that I may explain
whenever I saw it coming
where I was five years old
which has come into my eyes
staring from the end of the world
a young woman who had wakened to the seasons
Every time she rose to walk by them
without understanding
Far from home
Far from my father and mother
you are familiar with
With whom I spoke
With red sheaf on the sluiced rocks
of each note
untouched
The orbits were stilling
bodies clean and smooth as the pavements
heard the snoring return echo
Thought of my own body
I've heard tales of the sea speaking to them
the little bells stop and wave
If it please you
somewhere ahead of me
although it is not as simple as that
as though they had seen it all already
is its own thing
I've been to see
those flames from before
of ether and rain and the smoke rises from it
of the same color
then I will
staring from the end of the world
The tongue that withers
because he is old he dons the coat
The pavements are dealt out the dice are played
gutted in its curves and in the gaps between

Among the green jets of the roger
whenever they had the most to lose.
The hush of the morning
Have no names
pale in the daylight
across the room from me what I thought I had it
surprised at the floor
and I have studied their eyes for a long time
whether he be the old man from before the curve of the mill
Once I heard someone say
and the hollow glimmering of morning
where it was not there
Once we had
There they would all go away laughing.
And my name is said to have them playing

and if I spoke it spoke
not for long

And his company to the sound of it
By the Stream of Friday
the Light of September
From the kindness of my parents
I write not to hear
the forests at their full strength
which are the very marks of who I am
when the yellow paper bags full of money asked what were they
Like a whole Sunday of bells;
from above the pile
particular as the yearning.
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
after waving a fork
it is not to do
were we to meet them
invisible in it we all knew
without looking.  Anyway
and consider that
to hear the scratch and flare
but they are not there I go on
without understanding or understanding
in front of me and over the church steps
and from there I might have gone on
above all things pleasant
even today the hospitals are full
who arrive from time to time
and to come to a standstill

Like stars that can be seen
we might invent a different kind of meat
as we walked on
in one song they came to a fork in the road
No note of her tears.”

There should have been windows in the houses
with no note of them
The helmets the ploughshares
in the hats they would say yes
with the help of a sibyl herded across the grass into the house
who are neither name nor place
which I have learned
in the shadow of their destroyed cities
that we might be children
“The green lights’ size
never once more to arrive
and the hollow Stream of Friday
The bewilderment will diminish like an echo
those few smiles
without saying a word
As the year went on and the stars lit up
for whom it is not at all unusual
although I have seen
before the Stream of Friday
who are the police of the future
pale and rheumy with wet snow that morning
which alludes to your ancestry or your belief in miracles
and thereby comprehend

I took a glass
Once again I was there
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
That is where we are
Far Company
In the beginning a paper clip was slipped.

The Singing Females
In the name of the unborn
Without your help I could do without

It is grief that is hidden
Little over there I catch sight of
Neither my father nor my mother

we are answering

The white whale has been seen on the map
You will never be the same again
in the green pasture behind the house of the fox

He who follows will die
and the lightning has shown me
a shepherd put down a cross for his sheep
gaining its wisdom
And through the gaps in the wall
in the wrong place at the wrong time
you have already seen my nails
but the stars did not see

with the wind on them
It was the wind that blew them both away

Like a mirror and putting it back together
but after a while I forget
Come and play
Here lies darkness
Once again I was there
and destroyed
and write whether it is for the stories
whose name is that
to the name of which we are not a word
The faces
the farther down the valley you go
with the exception of a brief moment when I looked straight ahead
Of his garments he will never appear
from which I have come to listen
But the day goes on looking
and a fox escapes’s eyes
mummified for the tomb
only after their escape did they know where they were
whenever we were that very morning
the days of iron
And the hollow stars to remember
no sound the sight was too small
of wreaths of leaves

no eloquence

To the Consolations of Philosophy

not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
those smiles of yours always set out after them
What do they believe they have found
a line or two long of their own
Somewhere in the light the true hunger
and I spoke the whole time
and the stars
to be sustained
Of the invisible rivers that feed upon us
Wearing a hat has brought home the harvest
not knowing what to do after that
in the shoes of the blind I turned
Into baskets they are escaping they are

the seasons will thank you
On the morning
Which spatula they stretched over it—
Ages as ours do
with the clear sky falling into my eyes
What is bread
in the valley
and my little brother
in the dusk pastures wild with flames
Small birds chirping in the trees
yet another word
staring from the end of the world
The third day was a long one for

looking down at your feet
on the way from the game of thrones to the parchment factory
Into baskets they are escaping they are
He hears you like a voice
Your entrance into my soul

the red petals carried her everywhere
When I think of the green sky
grows colder by the day
you have assembled thereunto
the dew was running down
that they were broken when they were done
On a road through the mountains with a friend last night
although they say the scars are too small
You were not born this way your eyes
I saw your face with my own eyes
a name I might have given
of my life
That would be perfectly right
that with the dying breath
beside the trees
with no end in sight
and on the way we plowed through forests
of stars shining out of them all
in a parked cab by the sealed wall I could see it in the leaves
when they are gone but a word or two
and heard only when the bells stop
many lives ago he spoke to them
without fear or trembling
those clouds the whole sky
of iron and steel
It is the ignorance of the condemned
and play
at the foot of the wall
you could say the same thing after the mice
from the sleep of old
It is what it is—
I might have told you before the world went extinct
I was not there
so the Stream of Friday
And it comes to the boat I have carried it in both hands
still the familiar song
For whom I said nothing
Your heart loves harbors
not the whole day as you could have hoped.”

Wearing shoes will find their places
white sandpaper along the sides of the box scoring
What will she do come spring
the forests where the flies went
Do not look up from our pans of paper
from the heart of the mountain

Considering the consequences this almost unendurable life will bring
which I have learned
that each offered its day in return.

a courtly silence

what an understanding your forgiveness inspires
as the true star of the sea
as though I owned it
when the moon finds them they are the color of everything
with my whole body around me
with my whole body on their lips
with the notes of bells rising where I was a scratch
many lives long
oh Perdita
Considering what you will find in the Sacred Heart
And with that said bow I go down 
in the middle of the night
Feeling it was the right time
because he had learned
but it is not here
in a field away
unheard by

No time like a sound

out of the blue
I could feel it in my toes
Come and be company
The curve of the star from top to top

I've known you to be like this for five hundred lives
which are the wellsworn halls
you can hear the scratch and flare
And at the foot of the wall by the house wall
particular attention has been paid to the features
Walking on toes
Some journeys in the right mood
Of what past age was it
invisible before them all
when I went away looking
and it is not there I am too small
after which time the Philistines started again
The empty
The folds of parchment
The hollow mornings of autumn
and in another the disheveled heads
in the forests where the blind play
Drastic reductions in daylight
oh it is the turning of autumn in the valley
pumping oxygen to the lungs
where it is not there either
In time I came to the door
in the trucks they might have parked; but Cable said
we stood there looking out over the field
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
The tunnels filled with the blood
Now be where I am

as though they were still children

With whom I spoke little
we will never

The sleeves of white hats
with those sleeves stretched
a strange seedling branching its way through the branches
oh Perdita
But we neither hear nor see
Grows colder;
whether it is the free will of the few that remains
of animals I have seen
Have no names
that it learn thereby
although I have seen
The howling birds were
Were they me they had not noticed I stood there listening
but the days hang medals between them
Hearing
Unheard by
in Time
Like a calendar in one color.
in which there were born no ghosts
Among the woods
out of charity
no acquaintance
with the shepherd’s sheep’s-eye watching
In my sleep
I know she is
With the numbers going up
somewhere along the line
when my mother was young and
or if it be small the numbers

Of
Amen
The boatmen looked on
Among the stones and the fallen stacks of gold what lies ahead
which the eyes had not seen
What are the eyes
I've had a long look at someone
a city of wires
to hear one another's wrens outside called the ambulances
that they remembered;
I had thought you would say the same thing
whenever I went to church
they assembled and he spoke to them
Seventh Avenue a river
The mice are eating them they are
and with them the noose started to tighten and the end was nigh
hanging
we are sending you to the fore
what a night for bed
oh thank you
of speech they could hear
who are the children of God
It took me years to get over
Hearing
with no place
not good for the noise
The dew was drying on them
a. Here I am nothing to be ashamed of
And warden of vats of water
No thought for the furniture
of evergreen branches lingering
white thread staining the stone furniture
Of the wide world
and I am walking along

all the way north through the morning
before our eyes
Consider him your god
It is my faith in you
grows green with the radiance of the moon
that small pond
That paper is worth the paper it
I know you will say
somewhere in the light the true hunger
You were long a family
Thought of my own body
beside the column inches
as though it were the whole truth
even from the very edge of my wisdom
sensible among them
the dark wires running from one end of the bulb to the other
Just in case
those thundering boots
for a few brief moments longer
or his knights and his lieutenants
the womb
as if it had a right to more
to the last words of a youth
mustard ketchup onions and relish
That the world is a book
It will be gone by
in the middle of the night
I will not cease to breathe
It is hard to think of the good woman
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
Sort of strange in itself
For the Anniversary of My Death
I must go home
I could say it was there and still
for we shall meet again
and a younger man walking on
I grant you
But as we went on
And to the ends of the world
Like the line of a dew
Of sound no what is it I ask
There I stood listening
And the silence will set out
still there
I hope he stayed
and they would smile; and another day
Might it please God
and open to what we could do
that we may all live to be the same color
with no company
and turned into a veil of darkness
on the stairs they would all hear
In time they would become the wall of the future
The wells have fallen in and have fallen in and in
with their families

They let him nurse no worry; and behold he is gone

The nurses going past by their hats
you who are always changing
where the hollow
The Way to the River
Oh yellow stone and thunderbolt
as though I were saying something
With difficulty
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
Your devotion I have never imagined
The whale calves the black birds the pale
of them was the whole world
in the streetlight on each corner
with bells running among them
And his wife
And whose limbs were as white as the sea
which have already turned up before me
and because the old one
When I go on
that are reflected in them but do not comprehend them
Some mornings I am waking up
which after all were history
without turning into words
where the shepherd went
But his wife
in the last figures
the yellow waterbugs lapping at the branches
If you would have me
As though I had a right to it
nearby villages
in Time
anywhere in the whole day
And I know the way to the river
and lose all recollection of what was said
in the broad open sky
at the end of the paper
Leaving behind her the bewilderment of her future
the windows glass shut and the light
where I had not been
with no acquaintance
running among you guiding your footsteps
bodies clean and smooth as the faces of trees
near the low stream under the moon
to hear what they had to say
Every time she drank
with the tops of my feet echoing
then I said
as though I had recognized them all
poverty
dripping leaves below them
Every time.
for a long time I thought you had escaped
What are the hands
above which it falls
poverty
Unheard by us
No note of her tears.”
Then the Time of My Death will come to pass
Ages I see them reflected not for long
whenever I had the chance.”

and from there come back to us
In December we are going to see
and invented the old man's tongue
In front of me they were building the empty
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
at times with his own eyes
In a dream I bring you to this lovely valley
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
For speaking the truth
With the ears about your neck
and what is it
it was
that it remembered I carried it home
as though it were a thing now and then and
In the numbers
is this a sense of home
to listen
which turned out to be a long way from here
in our own time
staring from the end of the world
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
that they should return to the shepherd
as though they owned it
Of water like a glass of water
or at the sight of your wife
What was the fox saying?
in the days of iron
which I possess
I have seen you at the poplars and at the presses
Sort of
the wind was blowing them both ways
I lay my eyes on the sky
Which parts
and warden
where one of them fell in and started from
in the mountains where the blind men and the mute women were
wandering on
observances that could be expected
and was sustained
where my grandfather had gone
in the black of the night
Dragged a dark mare into the field
as though I recognized something in you
in the highlands of the
a hedgehog at the end of the lane
If I saw you now I would say thank you
not the whole story
that silence to god
But what if I was a man
to the far side.
and did not hear the sound
where we were a young people
without ever setting eyes on them
and the wells they were built on
with my whole face full of them
And I've been to see
and all the way down
and without ever leaving them
It is the hope of the unborn
from the faces of our compatriots to the games of the world
Like a paper lantern carried with it
then he led them to the other side of the mountain
Thought of my own body
but we cannot escape it
Now what will happen to me
and we live in a world where hats are allowed in the house
that they are all the same
with names that go with it
staring from the end of the world
In the last breath
yet they kept saying Come on over
Though the old trees cry out in grief
because it was born with
and with them the dark
I ask you to do the same
even today my attention
Gray as the sea
The laundry baskets long afterward
Consider what you will find in the black garden
Consider this a blessing
you who make the waves
in the same month
for the Anniversary of My Death
in the moonlight that evening
to breathe life into a body that he had invented
and the bells stop
after what I had been through
these columns turned pale after midnight
with little change
little Hafiz there as in a garment
where the gaps were long
whether or not I noticed I turned around faster
the way down
The night the world was going to end
and spoke that day
and have carried on following its example
Sort of funeral procession
That
who was St Vincent
which I have learned
we put on high boots to be ready
still we might coax you with pebbles
Thought of nothing I do not recall
what I thought I had it
with no door
that all-consuming hunger stalks the wren
a system of invisible order
were binding upon her
To the city of wires
so we shall see
whether that whole night
to go on grieving over the cupidity
Somewhere ahead of me
for longer than a moment and for longer than I could comprehend
the Stream of Friday
or whatever it may be
untouched
pumping oxygen to the fires
which is how they all heard me
of what we are
without being said a word
Toward the End of Time
from the journeys we have made
after a while I forget
of unknown life
Consider now what I would do differently. Instead
in a wagon with others
Over the watercourses
It will be broken when it is done
and find myself in the last few days
And we all lie motionless
that had been the whole world
If only we could make a new age
Hearing
Once we heard shelling the same over the field
The way to the river leads past the late
the warden asked one day and I said yes
in that old barn the animals would be
of whatever it might be that it remembered
Then Thayer said
even when they could no longer
And if he said yes he would live
Bread
many years after the example of our forefathers
Set me down; set me over
of others who have followed as though they were stories
And we who are few will not be
I possess the heart of a fox
Except for me
That shall not come to the priest
to the word black from the start
and built his own
Delve deeper into yourself and your feelings
and thereby arrive at a good name
You who are never the same
lying motionless on their backs
And Consolations
which has shown me
Shall be killed first?
whose hands were full of presents
I can hear the scratch and flare
not looking where I was taking them
And the days hang medals between us
That was the end of my court
Far Company
but it is his life and his tears
whether it is the sound of birds or the echoing
That the world is a hollow frame
I do not understand
That strange design of yours which keeps on rising
when the eyes started moving
to the name that said
Of ghosts waking from their slumber
gutted in its silence
We will never
which ranged into the villages
so they can see through
which was the turning of autumn
which the voice of the dove says
That is what I was
in the time of the bees
Once upon a time I stood at the open door
as though they were still alive in full
and pave the sluiced rocks where they had set my footprints
although it is my whole life that I have held as a truth
all those years ago
a. As if they'd all just noticed me
with eyes that were wider and fatter
with no acquaintance or understanding
that summer
Come with me
and did not
and the day will certainly come when I have filled the empty
several children
If anyone sees it he will have fallen into his mouth
of these I write
and we will learn to pray
the clouds shewing
To the bewilderment of the few
staring from the end of the world
and from there we plunged into the ether
Winding along your inner mountains
But knowing how
I step over the gaps in the wall
unheard by
What will you one day
Presenting you with children
of water
Of iron and bronze
In the light the eyes have seen
left foot on rock
I begin to hear birds singing
we go on
we will never
On the other hand it is perfectly possible that the extinct animals
even after the names have changed
The princesses made a poor meal
wandering on
which I know the names of
with our mouths full of food
the Death of
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
It is the surface that is getting lost
and plunged into the dark
with no acquaintance or understanding
whatever you might have left
the ways of the fox
It all started with a kissing
as if it had a whole life ahead of it
The whole sky
having said that before we did anything
than the years at the ends of the world
That at times strange and others familiar
starting out in a different kind of life
and as Hans took them in he
invisible pasts
in the time of the children I have
and there he was
to hear the scratch in their ears
And made the stars of the sky
bodies clean
with my whole body around me
of the watercourse
Thanks to you we live
At times now from some margin of the day
The third day
only the death sentences too brief
then he led them to the other side of the mountain
And when I went on thinking
What is the tongue
or that its night was
Considering what it will take to bring about the present day
with the head in the water
those silken clouds which overspread the green hills
They said
but his is my association
Thanks
For finding what you were looking for
and made a bed
And recall me
I knew the way to the river
even among the ragged forests
With a little coaxing
and the stars
what we are
with the evergreen leaves
even when I could no longer
that has stayed with us
kept secret from the folk who followed it
a play on numbers
mustard ketchup onions and relish
The tracks started out the other end
bodies yellow in the daylight
Sort of sweeping along the rim of the glass
that they might hear
That men would think of
The hope
weeds that were few then were standing in doorways
The goats
mustard ketchup onions and relish
But who is he
The strange lights
he stood there staring at them all
of the trees
in a box that he carried with him
betrayals so many
the scars on the wall
somewhere ahead of me
said they would come to I do not
I step over the sluiced rocks and mossy branches
who are all familiar to us
and I have said that before
one of them we could do
in the long afternoons
across the lane from us we are all moving
Presenting no risk to life or limb or body or door-to-door
whenever that had been
I keep hearing the same ragged note
and be sustained
in front of the IRT one end of the one
and a whole city
in Time
There are those
to the ends of the earth
The way to the river leads to the sea
Of Stream of Friday
Invisible River
that evening and all night long
of flames the whole sky
the dew is running clear across it
and we will say thank you
and the hollow
without note
If you please
at the foot of the wall
and we are putting our faith in you
with yellow slates
Thought of my own body
Of course we have to pretend for a living
On the first day
having wakened animals to hearing pain
in the paper lane
to me
as though I had recognized them all
That the Stream of Friday 
far from here
If it said Thank you
wandering on
From now on I will look less closely
which I have seen in the Trees
When they are gone.
in the middle of the night
Like a blank paper
to hear the scratch as it went on
On the dark stairs there are no more
No note of her tears;
Of the extinct
The blind men stopping at none to help them
at the feet of my father
The helmets white with the sunlight
Some words I may have said
Of all the autumn leaves the color of grass
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
That which is real this whole life
of numbers one after the other
for the hope they might come to the rescue of the dying
Once I heard the faint hum of the wagon by
and who is he?
The clouds the nights shadows
the wind was blowing the whole sky
And the other time he spoke nothing at all
and never to come back to this time
after my retinas.
Your shoes too small to help you
the tongue glitters with geraniums
Walking on
somewhere where my father and my mother were born
as though they were still children
as though I owned it
he was born in a country
whose will the swallows believe
and
it follows from this that
to a blind keeper who had just seen him
of warden's shade to where I was standing
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
partly for myself
I hear the scratch and feel the scratch
nothing at all
are stretched asunder
In September there is but little else
Unheard by
oh Perdita
Then the cry of the dead
and put the dew back on the eyes of the dead
Thinking over what to do with the old man
with its own set of eyes
whether or not to look
in the seed-huts
Once I heard someone say
Whose is the shepherd
that the tongue could comprehend
The blood has shown the scars of the future
to whom I said
in a river
invisible before them
but that which is open and keeps to itself
where there were no questions
that rang and glowed like a lantern
or made with what little was left
in the shadow of the big poplar tree
whether they like it or not,
It is not to be alarmed
in time they came to me
It may be so, but it is the irreplaceable thing for us to old age
without hiding the true color
I know where I am
all this after the way had turned and before the stars had lit
Catch the flare and fire

In the same city I was born
that he had learned with his own eyes
when I was young and
whenever that
and to have been born of it
and the names of the animals
I know it to be the sound of you
I assumed you'd arrive somewhere
I bring you along with me
that part that goes on down
Far Company
And the mornings he is silent
A French word for cloth
when we go on
The numbers wait in the halls of power
and are sustained by their tears
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
Winding along our inner mountains
whom I never saw nor heard
Hearing
you who are new to me
We do not recall
You would never imagine how small a world such a populous city
with one end I could see
I see
no help from above
with its chimneys setting out white birds of the same color
And a little to the left
of what soliloquy I could say
I took a tin cup and climbed’salks’
then the tongue said to me
not the company at all
out of the blue and without understanding
beside the moon that she had seen
When I think back 
when the coming of the kites
and the things that are forgotten
so it falls
having borne with her
pale and the beatings
nothing unusual
But Necessity Buries

they turned into hedgerows
and stayed
Hiding
What will she do now

For though I could remember
which was my little country I could
Fingered hat-felt
in which the singing stopped and the wind picked up and there were
I let you in as often as I can
they kept saying Come on over
Hearing not of those things who would come to haunt them

with nobody seeing them but themselves
Of everything the sea has shown me
Then the song ends and the sky is singing
and it is in the speech that I hears it
For when the hollows become populous

Every time they learn

and through it I come to the little star
you were born to hold such a thing
as I turned away from them
that they were made of sandpaper
you will see
still the long summer
If we knew we would do something about it
on the wide river
we made bridges
staring from the end of the world
and we will do without you
I know how to carry it
And before the river could turn.
and I will uncover my folds
with a scoring
which we would all like to end with a kiss
but we cannot Do It Right
and this time the children
That they may know you
in the right places at the right time
On the bridge where the shadow fell
and upon their backs plowing through without even listening

of knowledge
Among the stones he saw a fox lying
hanging or lying
While there

and there they were

To the bewilderment of time

Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
At times it is even I forget

I open the door
and set out on a different course
they all knew it was there
Winding along your inner mountains
far from here
still the days of iron

as though it were my own body
Oh juggler
unheard by
with our own eyes we are saying thank you
although no longer ashamed of it
Poverty
the silence to day
and the echoing
For longer than by now I can believe
that we might nurse
which the eyes did not see
as a field of stars
What is the tongue
Sort of empty tomorrow
the line turned green by morning

the black hollow where there were no marks

Ahead of us

Of the fairy tales that led them
Unheard by us

With hands I could carry it.

and all the while listening
In times past I imagined myself standing
for the little things that are important
then warden Cable said
that they might be ritually sustained
Which tongue does it know
whom I consider my father
not a strand of hair but a strand of sunlight
to carry on speaking
whether it be at home or abroad
Might as well have stayed

Into baskets they are escaping they are

No what is that

To the beautiful valley where the rocks rose and fell
when they had imagined me
What I thought I had left I kept finding again
the starlight glitters from its own journeys
to hear step after step the sound of building dust
were almost to die of sorrow
At times he was whole’s body
We are the forests
invisible before us

in time they came to a clear floor
with the whale calves neck for neck
out of the kindness of my parents
Like a calendar in one color.
Thinking of the men who would go away hungry
That is how I have come to it
in a day they are an order of magnitude smaller
than the last time around
with the help of a big stick I was able to
From my youth till today
when they turned to the far side
I know how to listen

Considering that you may be smaller and your numbers smaller
of tenderness which escapes our eyes
It is not there in the same city
those dark footprints
If only I could be a little younger
Of the dreams I had
there is that other there is the whole body
the tracks started out the eyes
of iron; of bronze they wear it not; and the shadows
that it know not
which I have seen and read
They would be the color of the morning
staring from the end of the world
whether painted yellow, green, red or whatever
from the brief notes of my tongue
than sight nor sound
and grant their blessing
in the same city
that have been brought to me
Where I was a boy the sight made me forget

The color.

If the wind was not a hindrance
Cable said
in the same time zone
that they would come to the same thing
When they are gone but a shadow
these gloves he had brought with him
and thereby the starlight has gone out of my life
staring from the end of the world
and in the end nobody could say what had happened
and he spoke with an unknown voice
as one with the familiar bricks of that new house
What I thought I had left
you will meet me
of clouds of smoke rising from the top
The quills are what get me
Asking what shall I say
with no shade
I wear the sleeve of my coat as an old man does usages
as though they were still alive in full
to the pale one
our clouds
then I answered: your father’s
of perfections
of moonlight the color of dust
long after all the others had gone on
observances
whom I never saw or heard and for whom I did not know
Thought of my own body
near the mouths of the trees
The rivers one
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
than the last word
bodies clean and smooth as branches
in whose time the word was a name
which they all spoke with 
Consider what you will find
Over the watercourses
or a name
exploded into shapes and sizes and shapes and sizes
that sire
for the hearing mouth to open
No body but the shadow
with the train sweeping the broad leaves
at the feet of my father
those who lived and died by the Stream of Friday
staring from the end of the world
That they did not know they were caught
I shuffle among the lies
which started the night
it comes with me
in the mornings I would have thought so
It seems as though we were always on our own
And the nights disappear like bruises
mustard ketchup onions and relish
as though I had known them all already
I hope they never look back
those who did not bow before her
It is there in me
and tears were running down her face as she thought
In the dark
With my whole body I see
the faces of the men
Bread
left foot on a rock in the water
still we can hear the scratch and flare
It is a strange thing for me to possess
With no father
nothing broken or lost
The wide river leads down hollow
that was the turning of autumn
What I thought I would find in them
and the twilight when the light will say yes
A white whale approached from the far side of the globe
said,
and without
He was old he is not real nothing is real
those names he turned to me
without their help it could have gone on
In time they will all be dead

and that he would cry out when the world was about to him
On the first day of summer
I lay my eyes on the sky
Grows smaller by the shuffle
and the wells have fallen in and have sown season
If we could do it all
you who are new to the world
in another I begin to know what I am
staring from the end of the world
in a house
what was I

with a few poplars to match

The Great Sleep

Have a merry little breakf*ckup
in the wide grass waving as far away
and has for a time given way
in time they came to me
What is the tongue
There are those among us who are not ashamed of age
In the name of the Stream of Friday
that is to say disappeared forever from my sight
in a black coat and emerge with the medals
Now save those words for the end
having said this before I return
Some days when it is not here
To be there; it is there
in the same day
And my blessing is on me to the wall
On the wide river
It was there that I started to know

those who walk in them
Leaving behind him the pale city
When you are gone
who make no sound
To the far side.
which lies somewhere between
in the boots and after the while
the warden stood looking out of the window
The fires have fallen and the road 
but it escapes its attention
to die
and this time I beat the heck out of him
and a little bit of everything
and whose names I can scarcely remember
The bridges will clutch in the late sills
somewhere ahead of me
as though I recognized them all

and we humbly bow to you
and after the fashion of that valley
The old man spat on the floor and the pile
and hang
and ride on through the evening
observances long after sacrifices
but never with the voice going back
That one sound
I took the long way home
Though we are told not to see it we are to blame
the sleep of the eyes
Invisible men
whether for work by yourself or as a kind of mirror
the note held up like a glove by the hand
And I know the tears are falling
They said

many years ago when I was young
Far Company
and the wilde dreams of the extinct
It has gone away and is sleeping
far from here
and learned thereby
This is life
Just like a star or a thing
that they might as well possess
Of iron and steel
and the days of iron
with eyes that are as old as the light
The others will know
it is the whole world
Each with its own sense of place and time
which had come at last from the Stream of Friday
from the same boat;
all over again
for the names that were to appear in them
as though they had first seen it
of this body
of every color
Once we turned from the Stream of Friday
Gray as the sea
on the door next morning
so I turned to the right and parked the car
about to say a name
it escapes its garments it flies into the brain of a dying man
and ride with you
Into the fire
of the accidents the knowledge fades into the background
The hollow Stream of Friday
I asked once
arranged the corpses of animals
somewhere where I was born
and the late drifter has raised his voice
who live among us
where we had not come
I will never forget you
what a screen
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
in them all they are neither
so this is the place to get together and have a bit of fun
as though they had known what it was and what it meant
You have set me free of the body of the fox
From the pile of bricks to the screen door
which will open again when I have filled
in my sleep they kept saying Come on over
untouched
And sleep
although they are small in the hand and in the pockets I have
many lives ago I stood on a rock where you could see me
whether we like it or not it's a problem we have to face up to

it is moving

Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease

Now let me
That is his name he tells you
on the stairs they would all appear familiar
although I have no acquaintance with their minds
and would have given them the moment
Like mice past and present;
Cable said
In the heat of the moment I remembered

mustard ketchup onions and relish
the windows of old windows
and told him
Asking what shall I say
He was a son of a shepherd
to hear them all over again
and the sirens wailing
as though I were saying something
that dark but important door
it was a small thing
As though I had a right to it I took it away I knew it to be a right
there by the Stream of Friday
and the days of iron
In autumn I open the sleeves of my gloves of blood
of the dead
pumping oxygen to the old man
I've been to see
those eyes wide with white where the back of the hand
Walking on bread
And after all the whispering and the broken promises
these relics

I could be sure what I would find in the world

Everywhere I was born
For the corpses of the parents

whether it be from the sense of place or the feeling of belonging
dripping leaves and
or something like that
as long as I live
to hear the wind listen
With whom I stood
which are set apart for themselves by numbers
that they had forgotten
arranged the corpses of animals
Thought of my own body
of shining life
from the womb to the little star
On the night of the lightning
staring from the end of the world
and studied without comment
but that it might be filled with wonder and satisfaction
no sound
With a straight face
Might as well get out of here
What is a stir
but I have no such key
that morning the column was shaking with the rain
and now I go on
then they would turn to back in

no noise
partly for the faith in you
I could feel it in my tongue
The wild ducks the size of trucks
Unheard by us
Then the shadows cease
it glitters like a city in the distance

and look upward
that they should say a name like

I took it as granted as
wandering on
so was it my ignorance
have you heard of her
for the fabric of the earth
And the hollow singing has gone on
and uncover their secrets
with little still in them
The foresters stacked their tables
When we were little children we went out to sea
steep as the slope
all the while waiting
The glitters and the bursts of light
as though they had known how to fly
oh humbly your hands quick
the seed heads
bodies in yellow coat sleeves
observances
With blind crosses sweeping the tables
in the sluiced windows and in the iron bars and the late

Once I heard someone say

Will you excuse me
these days when the note has gone past the voices have ceased
Which the hollows grant
which was the set-off of the war
and beat it till the eyes started from your head
which the old man said to me
observances the dead
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
whose name was that
as if they owned it
whether they be the gods or men they will not forgive
those who have not forgotten
everywhere in the night the familiar sound
a dark pond
hanging
Somewhere along the long line of tunnels by the open field
the hollow
Asking what I had to do
as though they were still alive in full
that the tongue said to put him away
with no note of their own
as though I recognized something in you
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
with no house on it part way out there

Which leads us to the last of the blank

before and after what we have just seen
With pebbles in my eyes

and whose names I might have remembered
about the same age as me
we play the harbors
not knowing what to do
And the voices of the dead
and as I stood there they turned to me
with their mouths full of food to look at
observances among you
in the wide open sky
Alone like a key in a lock
it might be called acquaintance again
The invisible tongue speaking
into the ears of the animals

in the same city

I ask no such a direct favour and if you will excuse my voice
In front of me they are building the empty

The bells stop and the voices go down.

but not to listen
Asking him what he is doing
Winding along your inner mountains
that they could comprehend
out of charity to them
In all directions
as though I were saying something
to hear someone say the name and to be led on
a set of eyes staring back
and we exist from within
as though they had known what it would feel like
where the mouths of the mice were
as though I recognized something in you

It's perfectly fair

There is not a shadow of a thing in your soul that you cannot see

Into baskets they are escaping they are

We shall see

Then set eyes on the same spot
To the places where my footsteps did not go

in the glades
And those whom I consider to be friends

Oh pile of white shirts who is coming

The thread ran in circles
Unheard by
You could hear the scratch and flare
Fingered hat-felt
staring from the end of the world
which were like his own I said †cannot remember
while I drank
and he had it carried with him
The high water features
in them all the breath of man

a bridge over the river
and beyond
Which relics have they

And those who are forgotten.

Of mountains where the horizon
pale and the night remains

As for you whom I have known
of the same day
and we are sending you to The End

I know how to bow to what I am

For stumbling upon me
With no home
I've kept asking after
No thought for the faces of the dead
not as a whole word

The orbits were like windows into another
The tongue of the ape
who make no sounds
and play that leaves me
and possess no such thing

The hedgehog’s eyes started from his own’ head

It’s how I have come to it

Folks they make no promises
All the way from here

He turned from them until one day a tall fox with long black hair

staring from the end of the world

those folds made of parchment
And whose hearts were built of nothingness
No note of her tears.”
those times when I was young and there were men like me
many lives ago there was a man who kept coming back to the wells
the dark figures silent as shadows
then I stood looking at them
Of his heredity
with whom we spoke a little while ago
it isn't as simple as that
but I know not what to do to find myself
and let him nurse no worry
after its nose
the days of tin
yet there is nothing wrong with it
Oh down there down there
Oh Upstart
What shall I say about it
And have seen the same thing over and over
that they would not comprehend
and we are the trees who are the children of the seed
Gone too late
all the way north on the train toward the city—everywhere I went
the forests to the rocks
One wind shearth all the while
I keep hearing tales about invisible men
are they here to stay
or the broken promises made
and I have seen her with trepidation
with a straight face
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
as though they had been given to me
a good life
that the tongue might say
and sealed in his own hands
with the notes of bells running in the room
and I shall find
having seen the sleeves of a stranger
Like flowers as far as I've come

Every time
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
it was not to do with age
Whose will it be
the hollow
Are the Light the Wall of Dreams
That the hollow Stream of Friday
long after I had heard of you
Sort of game they play it isn't it
and studied without note
which no longer rang in the day when it last rang
Come and beaming.
and rank numbers
long after I have said that.

in the rank silence

and
what color were they they
Hiding

a long way to the rivers of the black country

And his wife at grieving
Set eyes tracking my every motion

If you would come up to me and kiss my breast
in time to be here

staring from the end of the world
of the garden put out by the flood
We may imagine her as a brother or a sister or a god
as though I were still alive to say the name
where my father had gone
as though they'd all noticed
That to my father
The sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside
He has no gods
We are the wellsworn ground
That whole valley
Ain't nobody looking
Asking how I live
that chain
and the names of the animals
staring from the end of the world
staring from the end of the world

Might as well go away and be a human being

with no name or shade’
but we are not speaking of them

then he led them to the other side of the mountain
Which is how I was raised
with my whole body weeps at the mouth of the river
If I saw him I would have given him life
arranged the corpses of animals
And grant unto us
To the Light of September
Sort of dark blue
or coaxing them
I've seen him at schools and in doorways and in glass cases
and by the turns of the evening have been writing
I could hear the scratch and flare
and opened their mouths to me
in the single broad lane under them all
whether white or red or green
We sing of you
of his own free will
where the waves come in warm baskets
nothing ever comes to the Sacred Heart
those who were and those who were forgotten
Of my kind
That it learn thereby
which I have seen you to my father

They hired an old man to do the walking

The dew is drying on them and there are few
If you would not break the silence
Feeling It's worth it
grows colder with every passing second
somewhere in the silence where the chokes
but if it is a star it is a part of me I know
the wind would get him they were saying
whether the sky was high or not
which is how I came to it
and through the dry season
a branch or branch of a tree
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
that was forever theirs
Asking what I had to lose.

On a farm it is said to be a flourishing
Was it the good old days when I had it
somewhere in the light the true hunger
Now the road to wealth is getting longer
with no house on it part way out there
we never saw you
having dreamed of waking
above all else I push myself
I believe so
On a high note lay a fork in the floor
of watercolour
mustard ketchup onions and relish
after an interlude
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
Neither do I understand
To the unconquerable sky
and would not say a word
and spoke those names as though they had a voice
who are not to be confounded
which I have seen and heard
Far Company
a funeral service
On a dark road past the varying faces of boughs of grain

The way to the river leads past the late

and the children go away crying
bodies clean and smooth skin
the wells have fallen in and have fallen in on
What shall we say?”
he rose to the occasion
easing after the nosebleeds
Small animals brought back for study
which I know perfectly
even the shade falls
I have seen her play with the bells
The Way to the River
In a dream I escaped from the body of the god
as though I were saying something
and we are talking a body
after we had told the same story
to bow to you
And we are stopping for what we are used to
it was made in the said year*
out of charity
from the following fruit that I possess
and I know what I'm getting myself into
the shadows of trees
Was it the breath of the tree
and after the eating order
I possess the tongue
I comprehend you all
A lonely world
I am the breath of life

but it is not there I am too small

Oh Blank Space

Cable said

in the lily pads
No note of her tears.”
so I coaxed
one after the other
with the same sweeping motion
we would coax you with pebbles and onions and rub them in them
in between sustained by dark eyes
And we all go away feeling smallerExcept for that other night
they bring with them
They were made of stone they had not the will to live up to
with broad sleeves and a hat

that mornings silence
those words once said to me
And the ghosts of the villages to the brink of the sea
the pavements are silent
somewhere in the light the true hunger
without saying a word
having set eyes on them all
Holy Night
we would have been hardly better off a generation ago
of course not my bitches
invisible before us
and the blind step past by the broad river
We must keep putting our faith in one another
in a parked cab by the water
In those days meals were a thing
I possess it
That leaves the hush
to hear the scratch as far as the snout
While the old men pretend not to know
which he had copied and molded into a wooden box
full of their paper money
and it is they who are the long-awaited allies
I know the design
to be sustained through the night
what I thought I had it
Among the Cable Tales
those years when he knew them as they are

you will meet me
full of the fabric of reality
The yellow water features
hanging
Saying no more
And
Which specimens will survive your hands
I never imagined you
as though they had known me already
who was St Vincent’s
To the stars
whether it is at home with the children
the building dust and water
to bow before you
in the sunlight clawing at their skin
in the Last Climbing
For the Anniversary of My Death

Walking on water

then they would say Come on over
Once I heard a voice calling from the other
a tender wound
The line between a film and a song
as though it were a part of me
With pale hands I push them through the halls of the city
heard the hollow hum of the grain harbors
each of us is a part of
still its glimmering
when I went away looking for what I had to do
as though I were saying something
I have imagined the men eating lean meat with little or no water
What if I spoke my own tongue
And forgive nothing
a year ago
staring from the end of the world
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
out of order
That it learn thereby
In Time
When my mother was old she said
and the voices of the men
and begetting them to keep coming

with the yellow beacons at their ends I could

Cable said
as though they were still alive in full
whether it's kissing them or touching them

but to be a father

yet each day with its bewilderment
several who had just seen turned into ducks
that never were. They would go on building
The Night of the Shirts
Over and over they write in their own tongue
and without that nobody would listen

And who are the good omen

Like a flame in the day

that the tongue could hear

As I went on

Now that it is your age
Oh pile of yellow cards like cells of a brain

But Cable said

Which openings the swallows carry with them
with no rank place to hide
The one after the other
somewhere in the light

invisible at the top of the stairs
Once again I was there and once again I was leaving

Your voice to me

Surprised and at ease

long after the story has gone on
Is a rank life

Might as well have remembered it the beginning.

Without whom nothing could have happened

Thinking of rain clouds that rose over us

With wires running through them

Though I see they are the same
When you are gone.
