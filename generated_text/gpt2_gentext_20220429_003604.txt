One of the passers-by's eyes has just seen the same thing Three words for it<|endoftext|>
I remember thinking to myself over and over<|endoftext|>
It is not there in the same way that the other eye sees the same rock<|endoftext|>
Or the same spot in the sky<|endoftext|>
Or the same moment in time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I look back<|endoftext|>
It has been almost two years now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we have not seen each other in a while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far from each other as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we have not even glanced at the sky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or the features of the earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That are our own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
We are the color of everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our families<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our cities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our forests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our rocks and our lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are the color of everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our forests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our strata<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And our language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And our tongue<|endoftext|>

Call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time<|endoftext|>

Twelve days and twelve nights in a row in the police car can be counted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nights have been unusual in that they have varied<|endoftext|>

In years to come I hope she will say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
but she will say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once and for all what will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I ask you what shall I do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I go out into the garden to look for what I may<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food for thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
How often have I wondered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the soul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
A body that is not there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a soul in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That leaves the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And its darkness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To the far side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And its chorus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And its song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new age of music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Song of Three Smiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asking if you may<|endoftext|>

====================
Dearly snow white with it came with me and I walked with a fork in the trough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few feet away I was standing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and he had given me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The graveyards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full of the waiting of the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They kept saying Come with me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I had no way of knowing where I was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with that I turned south<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the road I kept on the wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The gorges were guiding me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the eyes started from my head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are the branches of the cherry tree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In front of me they are building the empty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ages I see them as though I were there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The houses in the distance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are the old houses in the time of the mice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
On the roof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a dream I returned to the land<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A land full of days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I return to the day when the mice are gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little house<|endoftext|>

====================
<|startoftext|>When I go away looking for what I have to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I begin to recall the days when animals were small<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hollow chipped rocks on the sides of the wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like columns of smoke I listen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the tinkling of the bells singing in the fields<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the tinkling of the waves building<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hollow valley below the sea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a river that has come to the surface<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And gone before. Thirty years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And foreordaining as stars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our sacrifices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Join your word to theirs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That it is we who are important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the Anniversary of My Death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every year without knowing it I have passed the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the last fires will wave to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the silence will set out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>they are the voice of the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I leave them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and go on living<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
where I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the North<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas<|endoftext|>

The ghosts of the villages they are not ashamed of leaving behind them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Land of the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start of text this is how I live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up here and simply<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There is no such thing as right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Neither the name nor the day goes on dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Like a paper lantern carried by a blind man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have seen the man's wife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Free of the circle of men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the invisible as the house of cards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In the evening he has healed the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loss after loss has been like the light of a candle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Overhead the seasons rock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are paper bells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling to nothing living<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The possessors move everywhere under Death their star<|endoftext|>

====================
And the bells go out in full force to the cities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England and Wales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Every time they play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With faces like those of a boy growing up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It isn't as simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winter will think back to your lit harvest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For which there is no help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of eloquence will open its wings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When you are gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But at this moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And our only<|endoftext|>

Chance is bleeding from me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When my one chance is bleeding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For speaking either truth or comfort<|endoftext|>

The Night of the Shirts<|endoftext|>

The foxes are eating the heads of the mice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They are eating the corpses of the men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the rich with their loot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the passers-by opening their eyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To each other first; then they break it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And demand that we return<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like ducks in the water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They will become extinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like the sea cows that were the afternoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the waterboys and the centenarians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will soon cease to be such animals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They will become extinct like the villages in the morning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At times now from ear to ear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From window to window<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could hear the birds and the sounds of the machinery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could make out the shapes and sizes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of persons moving through them<|endoftext|>

====================
<|startoftext|>
as though they had already noticed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and would have known<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell was going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
when I turned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Four feet up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fingered hat-felt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
fired from two different relays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of them was running<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far Company<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the head of the line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The white knights were about to order<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five hundred and one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five hundred and ninety-one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which of my many incomprehensions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you bequeath me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the boots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To look over the wall of the cave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And see That Comeback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be here what lungs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Followed them Under the Leaf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course he had to go along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the tunnels to the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home that morning was a strange one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hollow mornings a strange one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The clocks were carried on the crosses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Withmen at the windows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To each other first and foremost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my God at the beginning of the morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kept saying thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It was the sound of me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the dark river;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hiding place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For long after that same vision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the same river<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One that approached with a seeming power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was my left foot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a long way to the door<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To My Perinals Eyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And ajar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Morocco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the same hollow voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That came running down the stairs<|

|<|startoftext|>for the forgiveness of your sins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>here and now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as ever before in your own life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with no memory of the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
When you were little anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>was better than everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>is possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>holding on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I can hear the sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
it belongs to a more profound place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
come to consider<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what you would do differently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
you might say so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>although it may be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that is the difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
between what you would do differently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and accepting it as it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>has set you free of the body<|endoftext|>

of dry blood the tongue carries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with it<|endoftext|>

Over the watercourses<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making a new twilight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again again with its pointless sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the moon finds them they are the color of everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed<|endoftext|>

about the princesses and the harbors and the escapes and the escapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the escapes with no trace of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>after the name has forgotten it and the light has forgotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Everything that has gone on before was possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when the powers that be said yes and with no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
information the New Yorkers would offer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to the princesses and the harbors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and the hidden openings in the glass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to keep an eye on them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and to keep an eye on the knights and the minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the minutes of the knights who entered the rooms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here comes the invisible stranger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The man who has no name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we say the same for the princesses and the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
purses and the windows and the escapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the invisible stranger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one with the wide world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other with the wide world[–]
<|startoftext|>That great god<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
All these years behind windows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
====================
There have been those before me—those who have come before me—those who have followed after me—those who never left the house of my footprints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forerunner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little dry death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As we walked on it was obvious that we were all descendants of the same tree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That tree whose branches grew up in the most remote corner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And whose limbs were as long as a foot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And whose joints were as long as a grain of grass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And whose hearts were as old as the light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And whose names were as long as those<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That tree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which names were composed of countless words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And those who wrote them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
There are the names of the noblest of those who knew them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And those who have forgotten them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
As the seasons change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the morning they are everywhere strange and familiar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the nights disappear like bruises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the days hang medals between them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are everywhere cool and steady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the days hang medals between them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sort of like a hat game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except the haters are different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Like a song about how long it takes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sleeves of the hats getting broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bridges are crumbling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The clouds are setting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nights are getting longer and the days are getting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long after my father had left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And lay claim to the fatigues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of his days he is forgotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In the time of the mapmaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I yielded to his wishes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While he went on inventing new ways to tell tales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For the Dead<|endoftext|>

In this amusing map of Istanbul I was born<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the same city I was born in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was young the forests were a distant memory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
For a long time I thought they were forgotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are what we live with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Hungarian line of mountains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I go on thinking about them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor thing is made of patience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Will not say a word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
about me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After my death do not look up from my maps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took them as a sign that I was living<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That they are broken as the sea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The dead go away like bruises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands<|endoftext|>

The waves of the ocean spray the night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cities decay into the sea<|endoftext|>

Standing in doorways<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And yes ends out of cafes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In streets full of drinkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in numbers at doorways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And at knotted doors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With no man on it<|endoftext|>

Needing no other<|endoftext|>

The rank mulatto sluiced with sage and plum-flowered with a strange irises that glowed like a moonlit garden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the names of the trees he kept telling me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the days I thought I had left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kept finding in the hollow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of the silent river a rising star<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That rose to the top of the wall and where the still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water's dark bruises appear where the dark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is a mark of the absence of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have imagined the green sky after the French<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Troops coming and going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their bells stalling<|endoftext|>

Give what I can<|endoftext|>

====================
|startoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I went away looking for the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I found it on a road through the mountains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A house built of stone and with windows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could see it already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half-mooned and half-crowned and with hinges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could see it had left the frame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the beam of the flashlight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sign of the cross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remembering names to put in their own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bodies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small but the numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Start with the bellies reaching into the folds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the touching of their faces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the sound of their voices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One after the other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In time they were the same color<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They took them everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In time they were the same size<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smaller in the eye and bigger in the brain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the seeing eye picking out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What were they I asked what were they<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext
====================
There are no marks on the map of my feet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have assumed the form of a smaller body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I have seen nothing of it<|endoftext|>

Only after much reflection will I emerge from them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One dark morning I was walking on a field<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A light-colored fox followed me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a field of wheat field<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Walking on wheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A strand of grass behind me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A hedgehog followed me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a road through the mountains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fox stood watching me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a road through the valleys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A hedgehog followed me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a road through the heads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fox stood watching me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a road past the wrens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A hedgehog paused and paused<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
top of the third wall with a raised floor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>in the middle with a top floor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>in the top row with the dark bust of Jack the Ripper<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No what was the man eating<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
You have to see this it’s an ape bring<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>so he brought the boy along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a wooden plate he brought with him<|endoftext|>

and a handful of water bring me to where the boy was sleeping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and where the little boy was going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
after the way<|endoftext|>

The bell rang.
The news spread faster than the words could convey. Dozens of cars were stacked high in the rain.
The officials announced a traffic stop. A handful of drunkards stood in traffic. A handful of black hats with the words "No police" on them.

it tastes of home<|endoftext|>

nothing else ever seems to happen<|endoftext|>

The helmets the flags the bells the clouds the flags of death—these names the names of the lost families<|endoftext|>

Into baskets they are being led<|endoftext|>

I studied there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as though it were a tongue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
of water that stood in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>there on either side of me they had all been<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pumping oxygen to the lungs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in an oxygen tank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for hours on end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as though it were a system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
of water that held it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and was standing out in the open<|endoftext|>

holding on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could feel it in my tongue<|endoftext|>

staring down at each of our faces<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>as though it were an order<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could feel it in my tongue<|endoftext|>

Saying no more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And silencing a people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is how I came to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A people whom I thought was peaceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
But when I went on believing in them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are nothing if not broken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glass windows and crevices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call and none of it is there<|endoftext|>

Walking on glass objects in the dark<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I asked what if<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each glass had its place<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Which were raised not far away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And set before the assembled people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The names of the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which were borne pale on the wicker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>St Vincent’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among the pile of green trees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where the blind led<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their footprints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their bellies full of money<|endoftext|>

On many occasions when I was young and as old as the stars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have imagined the blank faces of the men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Whom I did not recognize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have imagined the breath taking in the garments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
That I had imagined somewhere else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have imagined the dark chokes of the factories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That have long since been reduced<|endoftext|>

left the light at the end of the tunnel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Room after room asking how shall I live<|endoftext|>

still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ask only<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
to pray for the dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to keep looking out for the long haul<|endoftext|>

Something big was going on behind the wheels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I remember the look on my father's face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He would say thank you<|endoftext|>

It has been my whole life.
Nor have I noticed.
Nor have I noticed the way things have gone on.
What are the details?
The old man is gone. He is no longer old man. He is neither here nor there. He is simply gone now. There is nothing wrong with him.
What is the mind?
Everything that we are is gone now.

<|startoftext|>When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye<|endoftext|>

Chance is bleeding from me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When my one chance is bleeding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For speaking either truth or comfort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no more tongue than a wound.<|endoftext|>

The Night of the Shirts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh pile of white shirts who is coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to breathe in your shapes to carry your numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to appear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
what hearts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>are moving toward their garments here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>their days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what troubles beating between arms<|endoftext|>

your name and the hour tells of you<|endoftext|>

you stood out among the crowds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>white knights with black coats and gorging on over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tireless ride through the blackened woods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
full of the waiting of your feet but a word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>before you turned green<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the late birds were gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but the tapes of your dreams fresh from your fingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
you gave to the church at grieving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>your first birthday and then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
never a moment too soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for we were children3|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
never waking we were old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and our last words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
unknown to us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fire upon fire our age<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
whenever that had been<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>more solitary than single snowflakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>with nowhere to hide you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>where we seemed to be nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what we were<|endoftext|>

There is the silence that is the end of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hour is out of hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the clock is running out of the wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is the darkness that is the end of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hour is ending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hour is calling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Body of water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From here to the sea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The black water slide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toward the feet of his father<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Where his mother was born<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There and then the mouthful was that filled<|endoftext|>

Every day grew longer and the still afternoons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ripened the distance until the sun went down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it was the time of year when I was born and that evening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to see friends for the last time and I came back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>after midnight along the road white with the moon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the wide silent valley full of silver light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and there just at the corner of the land that I had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>come back to so many times and now was leaving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
at the foot of the wall built of pale stone I saw the body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I carried her home to bury her in the garden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and to stand afterward in the turning daylight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and

<|startoftext|>only by the room's size did I see<|endoftext|>

tracks of the same creature<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not just at the moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I know you will say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have said that before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you have been<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>there all along somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in another time zone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I studied once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>those beautiful instructions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when I was young and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
far from here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they seemed distant then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they seem distant now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>from everything I remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I hope they stayed with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when the noose started to tighten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and you could say no more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and after wisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and the days of iron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the eyes started from your head<|endoftext|>

Some good news for those saying so<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‘Come up behind me and go on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahead of me and come up behind me and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With different keys clinking in the pockets<|endoftext|>

And still I do not move<|endoftext|>

Or the breath of the mouse<|endoftext|>

Or the note of the blower<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They are not important<|endoftext|>

still warmer than the morning sunlight<|endoftext|>

staring from the end of the world<|endoftext|>

at the scene of the tragedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Witnesses will be brought to justice<|endoftext|>

as though they had followed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>their fatherlands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in their days as gods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you would think they would have noticed<|endoftext|>

they do not<|endoftext|>

ready to go home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to tell them about the ride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
or from seeing the empty road<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>standing at the top of the hill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
raising his voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in a French speaking voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There you have it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the stories about returning to their own land<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
or the journeys with their mothers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the men leaving the lane after the woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
exploring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the dark elevations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and the dark burrows<|endoftext|>

where the fall had gone on before<|endoftext|>

No note of her tears.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Cable said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your hired man nor maid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your dog nor shadow<|endoftext|>

Nor your ape to be led.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once I heard someone say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That the hollow Stream of Friday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Is a rank place to lie;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes me sorry: have you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought of my own body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I was always good to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The frame that was my devotion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my blessing was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The straight bole whose limbs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Were long as stories—<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the Stream of Friday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And the breath coming soon after<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But at this moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That we who follow you invented forgiveness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And forgive nothing<|endoftext|>

from those who had painted animals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your voice is falling faster than sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stairs leading down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are stacked high<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And stocked the rooms with the long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>boats filled with food<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From time to time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dressed in the gray coat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the tie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have left the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A stranger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dressed in the white coat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the tie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have left the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A stranger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Surprised at the earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the sea of gold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see how it is done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the other morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember the sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toward the feet of my father<|

<|startoftext|>
Over the river it grieves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the Stream of Friday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the extinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Native Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Asians Dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In the Last Year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before the age of the mapmaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you would expect to find among the relics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of silver plating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>on the flags of the extinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
And the irreplaceable promises made to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
By the Stream of Friday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you will not see again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the extinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Will not know you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here lies the hunter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
The invisible hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>somewhere in the light the true hunger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>appears to be passing them by<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
They will not see you<|endoftext|>

====================
There is nothing wrong with me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>although I have noticed that the grass is getting greener<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the boards falling faster than the words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
have noticed and it is getting warmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What am I to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
It seems that the noose has got to be finding a way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tight or it will try to push the other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
back. Here is a man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To My Name is Strong <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alone this world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a small house in the snow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With no manning or light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Here comes the old man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tireless traveler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like the beam of a lightless star<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes the old man with the name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the old man without the name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
He was old he is not real nothing is real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Nor the noise of death drawing water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are the echo of the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the door it says what to do to survive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we were not born to survive

<|startoftext|>At times now from some margin of the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can hear birds of another country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not the whole song but a brief phrase of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
out of a music that I may have heard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>once in a moment I appear to have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>forgotten for the most part that full day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no sight of which I can remember now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
though it must have been where my eyes were then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that knew it as the present while I thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of somewhere else without noticing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>singing when it was there and still went on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
whether or not I noticed now it falls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>silent when I listen and leaves the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and flies before it to be heard again<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
out of charity and with no place in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you will hear from me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when you are older<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you will see how little I matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was young<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a time of waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the right opportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That future is here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The future is here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That great city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That old temple<|endoftext|>
