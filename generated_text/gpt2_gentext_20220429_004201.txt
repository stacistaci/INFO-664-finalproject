To the Blank Spaces
====================
As we went on
====================
and by the curve of his sister's neck
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Of sage and of iron and Grey cardinal
====================
they said go away and write what you will
====================
Now I know
====================
in their wheat underarms
====================
Unheard by us
====================
you will find that wherever you are it is all the same
====================
grows colder with each passing day
====================
the wide open land
====================
and set free of it
====================
Among them I see them all turn to each other
====================
Of whom I say not a word</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Except at Christmas and New Year's when I have not seen You
====================
but the wells were poorly lit and the animals huddled
====================
when I listen
====================
The children will cry out
====================
and gave them to St Vincent’s Hospital in the name of all—
====================
to the small garden where I was born
====================
starting out small you know you have come to know me
====================
appears to be passing them by
====================
not allowed to move
====================
in a pasture the still green tree trundled high in the garden
====================
In the glass columns the eyes have seen
====================
and made numbers numbers letters[*endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
many-colored.”
====================
whereof I had no such knowledge’s
====================
A lost cause
====================
The glitters
====================
whatever the case
====================
Once I heard the scratch as they passed me
====================
without recognising it at all
====================
those dark feet
====================
Will ever find itself
====================
It is as though I were here
====================
that it learn thereby
====================

====================

====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
but for a time he stayed
====================
an old man with ailing limbs
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
still we are told not to see them
====================
even now the last leaves
====================
The wheels turning green in the headlights
====================
but the voice of the dead
====================
The valley is wide and dry
====================
in the columns the flames have gone on
====================
Binding
====================
the whispering birds
====================
and the twelve ghosts ‑
====================
oh Cable said
====================
Asking what is my field
====================
I would like for you to survive
====================
Cable asked what it would take to get out of the home

====================
who have they forgotten
====================
I could hear the scratch and flare
====================
and its nurses
====================
with my whole body he took with him
====================
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have a chimney at all do they have a system of doorways
====================
Though I see him as though it were another time
====================
Little hush
====================
as far as the last word
====================
To the vendor
====================
with our eyes we are saying thank you
====================
I move them
====================
which at the same time I knew I had to do something
====================
that the tongue could grasp
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
who live on beyond the horizon
====================
for longing
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
or at least I suppose I was until I remembered
====================
I might have guessed from the order in which
====================
and sealed in his own skin
====================

====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
and the night the shepherd hid he found her hiding in the branches
====================
which has become my whole being
====================
As we walked on
====================
several of the windows looking out over the garden
====================
who were as old as the horizon
====================
across the room the hum was complete
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
as though I had known them all then
====================
as we neared the end of the film there was a silence
====================
in Time
====================
in the middle of summer
====================
of iridescent glass’
====================
If it were true
====================
the third day
====================

====================
What are the feet
====================
whenever we might like;
====================
of woods the color of dust
====================
Every time he went on
====================
those pale calves the size of a smallpony
====================
without thinking of it
====================
and would do anything to be closer to her
====================
with an oh-so *slant in it
====================
a hand in every eye
====================
Then spat I the mouthful of water
====================
Somewhere along the road a strange creature had appeared and spat on the ground
====================
of the fabrications that go with it
====================
with the flashing of the little lights
====================
Which I know I have left
====================
whether young or old, rich or poor
====================
Abandon yourself from the sight of me
====================
where the wells were made
====================
of silence as though it were still possible
====================
Which spoke of her so

====================
to see that it could all be turned over
====================
although it be years
====================
in Time
====================
the flags of the past
====================
oh humbly believe that they have an eye for the past and a wits about it that none of them possess
====================
Of a starlight chain gone through photosynthesised cells
====================
To the glitters of morning
====================
With birds chirping
====================
in the wide open lakes
====================
It will not escape.
====================
Now go home to rest
====================
I lay my heart
====================

====================
So my friends
====================
where the sea cows were a running joke
====================
To the hush of the morning
====================
far away in time
====================

====================

====================
I've seen him in the sleeves and boots
====================
kept secret from the other;
====================
you cannot help but believe that the Sacred Heart of
====================
and brought with him
====================
Dragged his scales and set them on him
====================
I can hear the scratch and flare
====================
in a film made of them
====================
then it came to me
====================
Now I know
====================
Of far gone meanings
====================
Among the gray woods
====================
The words go on rising from the grave
====================
which went on rising on the table
====================
one that was to come
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
If I were you
====================
in the back of the cab by the hedge
====================
I find myself looking back at the sky
====================
with the night the true star of music
====================
The limbs long
====================
You would think so little of a thing
====================
Which way was the church built
====================
and a blind man she sat by the window looking out
====================
not a word they can only hear The feet shew no wrongs The fires they cannot extinguish She will not undo The shadows push their tears
====================
while my father and my mother worked
====================
and the days of iron
====================
The orbits were still in them
====================
There is nothing at all like a clean day at the office
====================
Oh sky so vast
====================
Neither my father nor my mother nor my father or her husband
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
pumping oxygen to the old man
====================
that they might be as long as they were
====================
and carried on without looking back
====================
Who are the children of God
====================
full of the ride home
====================
no thought given to age
====================
we are calling a whole world to arms
====================
|
====================
bodies yellow in the daylight
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
to hear others humbly talking
====================
invisible ray
====================
Hearing
====================
several feet up
====================
with a big wave of my middle finger
====================
The wires going in through the holes
====================
and they are building a new world
====================
and what is there to it?
====================
what are the feet
====================
so this word is
====================
though they were older and smothered in darkness
====================
Might it excuse me
====================
The feathers went up like smoke
====================

====================
and taught me
====================
It is not a name I understand
====================
That whale
====================
as the invisible sleeves on that mountain around
====================
Somewhere where we were born
====================
whether we like it or not,
====================
and would say no more
====================
which is how I have come to it
====================
muttering
====================
and they would break into smaller ones
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
he had said before ‘I've’ no excuse to be stuck here turning
====================
have the same features
====================
The feathers of the owl raised its dark oaks
====================
When I went away looking
====================
for the Anniversary of My Death
====================
The same old rain forest with the trees gone tomorrow
====================
The dog-eat-dog age
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
what were the stairs
====================
Far Company
====================
which we have all learned over and over
====================
whenever they were small but the men always stayed
====================
flowing out of them
====================
Among the hollows
====================
staring down at each of our faces
====================
The sleeves of the shirts getting soaked in the rain
====================
I lay your name by my voice
====================
The necklaces
====================
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
====================
with the engine running
====================
On a road through the mountains
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
of the same river
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
Here and now
====================
And my only
====================
Now to the end
====================
several of the windows painted in the same shade
====================
who make the notes of waking sentences
====================
and we all started our days much earlier
====================
When I went away looking for where I had come
====================
observances at funerals
====================
Holy intercession; let no one do you any such thing
====================
And the old man from before he had a chance to say a word
====================
with a few notes of rank water
====================
unheard by
====================
are said to have fallen into their eyes
====================
observances for the dead
====================
that are what they are
====================
whenever the offer was.”
====================
still it comes to Ibragas
====================
after the names
====================
so will he
====================
heard birds about the Twenties and Twenties

====================
invisible before them
====================
I can hear the scratch and flare
====================
and the horizon grew smaller
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
oh by the Stream of Friday
====================
of the same color
====================
full of their air
====================
who is tall as the sky
====================
who are we
====================
Which forests the stream heads have forgotten
====================
looking up step by step into
====================
And put on a hat and go
====================
It is what it is
====================
the pain has gone through me
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
And bow to the Almighty
====================
and dealt the day over with equal ferocity
====================
that started with the eye
====================
in that same lane’s eyes
====================
appears to be going on
====================
although they would comprehend
====================
in the Twenties
====================
Who are the compatriots
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
of things I knew very little at the time and now I know
====================
which Ransom had left at Christmas
====================
Now set eyes on me
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
on the dark figures
====================
heard the faint hum of the building
====================
the color of blood
====================
we are speaking of
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================

====================
without note or understanding
====================
which were neither lit nor made clear until a while later when the starlight grew smaller and smaller in the south
====================
But it will not escape.”
====================
yet without understanding
====================
a new age
====================
were standing there singing and it was none of my business how I dealt with it
====================
Inhabitants
====================
in the twisted daylight
====================
The wide river leads past our heads
====================
Your starlight glitters with the tears of the
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
Just after sunrise they had heard the snoring
====================
A mirror to the other
====================
those whom we consider as families
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
Then no man nor creature could push him;
====================
have they fallen in love with one another
====================
and the years have gone by
====================
in the last year
====================
A swirling blue sky
====================
a time and place
====================
Just as I had imagined it to be there
====================

====================
where it is not there I do not see
====================
and make a stone one at a time
====================
The boat came to a stop on the bridge
====================
we would all be dead before we had a chance to think
====================
shadows over the ground
====================
and that his name was
====================
which his hired man nor maidservant
====================
On the one hand I am a man of few words
====================
The boat white with the moon
====================
which is how I came to it
====================
having thought it might be used
====================
and the nights disappear like bruises
====================
that I may explain
====================
whenever I saw it coming
====================
where I was five years old
====================
which has come into my eyes
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
a young woman who had wakened to the seasons
====================
Every time she rose to walk by them
====================
without understanding
====================
Far from home
Far from my father and mother
====================
you are familiar with
====================
With whom I spoke
====================
With red sheaf on the sluiced rocks
====================
of each note
====================
untouched
====================
The orbits were stilling
====================
bodies clean and smooth as the pavements
====================
heard the snoring return echo
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
I've heard tales of the sea speaking to them
====================
the little bells stop and wave
====================
If it please you
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================

====================
although it is not as simple as that
====================
as though they had seen it all already
====================
is its own thing
====================
I've been to see
====================
those flames from before
====================
of ether and rain and the smoke rises from it
====================
of the same color
====================
then I will
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
The tongue that withers
====================
because he is old he dons the coat
====================
The pavements are dealt out the dice are played
====================
gutted in its curves and in the gaps between

and lay the nails
====================
Among the green jets of the roger
====================
whenever they had the most to lose.

====================
The hush of the morning

Have no names
====================
pale in the daylight
====================
across the room from me what I thought I had it
====================
surprised at the floor
====================
and I have studied their eyes for a long time
====================
whether he be the old man from before the curve of the mill
====================
Once I heard someone say
====================
and the hollow glimmering of morning
====================
where it was not there

Once we had

There they would all go away laughing.</|endoftext|>

not knowing what to make of her

At times it is almost impossible to tell what is real and what is imaginary

And his company to the sound of it

By the Stream of Friday

the Light of September

From the kindness of my parents

I write not to hear

the forests at their full strength

which are the very marks of who I am

when the yellow paper bags full of money asked what were they

Like a whole Sunday of bells;

from above the pile

particular as the yearning.

Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease

While he was writing he noticed a band of white men singing and stopping to bow and to wave.

after waving a fork

it is not to do

were we to meet them

invisible in it we all knew

without looking.  Anyway

and consider that

to hear the scratch and flare

but they are not there I go on

====================
without understanding or understanding

in front of me and over the church steps

and from there I might have gone on

above all things pleasant

even today the hospitals are full

who arrive from time to time

and to come to a standstill
====================
and
====================
Like stars that can be seen

we might invent a different kind of meat
====================
as we walked on
====================
in one song they came to a fork in the road
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================

====================
There should have been windows in the houses
====================
with no note of them
====================
The helmets the ploughshares
====================
in the hats they would say yes
====================
with the help of a sibyl herded across the grass into the house

who are neither name nor place

which I have learned

in the shadow of their destroyed cities

that we might be children

“The green lights’ size

never once more to arrive

and the hollow Stream of Friday

The bewilderment will diminish like an echo

those few smiles

without saying a word

As the year went on and the stars lit up

for whom it is not at all unusual

although I have seen

before the Stream of Friday

who are the police of the future

pale and rheumy with wet snow that morning

which alludes to your ancestry or your belief in miracles

and thereby comprehend

Far Company

at a time when the forests were being destroyed and the mangrove is being made into a garden

I took a glass

Once again I was there

When the moon finds them they are the color of everything

That is where we are

Far Company

In the beginning a paper clip was slipped.
====================
somewhere between meals

With almost no thought the boat came to a stop on the bridge A BRIDGE OF BOWSER A shadow of the other carried the boy across the water Download video <|startoftext|>To the other side of the cup a BRIDGE OF OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD 
====================
when I went away looking for what I had to do

and we will find a new world

Which wells they follow

As the day went on with the head free of the necktie

whenever that solitary life was

we are answering

a vision of complete darkness

Like a mirror and putting it back together

Once again I was there

whose name is that

With long afternoons when the lights are out and nobody is looking what we are doing

What will she do come spring

Do not look up from our pans of paper

from the heart of the mountain

untouched

Considering the consequences this almost unendurable life will bring

which I have learned

that each offered its day in return.

Every time they assembled there were gathered

Walking on Sunday

The fear of the forest

wandering on

when I go out

easing past turns and gaps

With voices going back

a courtly silence

without changing the irreplaceable features

That they call own’s Hereford Christmas’s

what an understanding your forgiveness inspires

as the true star of the sea

as though I owned it

when the moon finds them they are the color of everything

with my whole body around me

with my whole body on their lips

with the notes of bells rising where I was a scratch

many lives long

oh Perdita

Considering what you will find in the Sacred Heart

And with that said bow I go down

in the middle of the night

Feeling it was the right time

because he had learned

but it is not here

in a field away

Winding along your inner mountains

It is my whole life that it lay within me

To the rank birds

sensible

I have seen her smile on them

No time like a sound

which I had heard before; now I knew as well as I could what was going on.

====================
but both my father and my mother
====================
That it learn thereby</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy charity.
====================
as though they had recognized me
====================
he led them to the stairs where they stood
====================
out of the blue
====================
I could feel it in my toes
====================
Come and be company
====================
The curve of the star from top to top
====================
and carried him home
====================
I've known you to be like this for five hundred lives
====================

====================

====================
which are the wellsworn halls
====================
you can hear the scratch and flare
====================
And at the foot of the wall by the house wall
====================
particular attention has been paid to the features
====================
Walking on toes
====================
Some journeys in the right mood
====================
Of what past age was it
====================
with the exception of a little while ago when there were a great many
====================
invisible before them all
====================
when I went away looking
====================
and it is not there I am too small
====================
after which time the Philistines started again
====================
The empty
====================
The folds of parchment
====================
The hollow mornings of autumn
====================
and in another the disheveled heads
====================
in the forests where the blind play
====================
Drastic reductions in daylight
====================
oh it is the turning of autumn in the valley
====================

====================
pumping oxygen to the lungs
====================
where it is not there either
====================
In time I came to the door
====================
in the trucks they might have parked; but Cable said
====================
we stood there looking out over the field
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
The tunnels filled with the blood
====================
Now be where I am
====================

====================
no thought for the tall tales that would follow
====================
as though they were still children
====================
what has gone poorly with the goblets
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
were torn in two by the wind
====================
With whom I spoke little

we will never

which were set apart for this occasion

that is to say 普段、早言此

The sleeves of white hats
====================
with those sleeves stretched
====================
a strange seedling branching its way through the branches
====================
oh Perdita
====================
But we neither hear nor see

Grows colder;
====================
whether it is the free will of the few that remains
====================
of animals I have seen
====================
Have no names

that it learn thereby

although I have seen

The howling birds were

Were they me they had not noticed I stood there listening

but the days hang medals between them

Hearing
====================
Unheard by

in Time
====================
Like a calendar in one color.
====================
in which there were born no ghosts

Among the woods

out of charity
====================
no acquaintance

with the shepherd’s sheep’s-eye watching

In my sleep
====================
I know she is

With the numbers going up

somewhere along the line

when my mother was young and

red herrings

Of

The boatmen looked on
====================
Among the stones and the fallen stacks of gold what lies ahead
====================
which the eyes had not seen
====================
What are the eyes
====================
I've had a long look at someone
====================

====================
a city of wires
====================
to hear one another's wrens outside called the ambulances
====================
that they remembered;
====================
I had thought you would say the same thing
====================
whenever I went to church
====================
they assembled and he spoke to them
====================
Seventh Avenue a river
====================
The mice are eating them they are
====================
and with them the noose started to tighten and the end was nigh
====================
hanging
====================
we are sending you to the fore
====================
what a night for bed
====================
oh thank you
====================

====================
of speech they could hear
====================
who are the children of God

It took me years to get over
====================
Hearing

====================
with no place
====================
not good for the noise

The dew was drying on them

a. Here I am nothing to be ashamed of
====================
And warden of vats of water
====================
No thought for the furniture
====================
of evergreen branches lingering
====================
white thread staining the stone furniture
====================
Of the wide world
====================
and I am walking along
====================
forgotten name
====================
all the way north through the morning
====================
before our eyes
====================
Consider him your god
====================

====================
It is my faith in you
====================
grows green with the radiance of the moon
====================
that small pond
====================
That paper is worth the paper it

====================
I know you will say
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
You were long a family
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
beside the column inches
====================
as though it were the whole truth
====================
even from the very edge of my wisdom
====================
sensible among them
====================
the dark wires running from one end of the bulb to the other
====================
Just in case
====================
those thundering boots
====================
for a few brief moments longer
====================
or his knights and his lieutenants
====================
the womb
====================
as if it had a right to more

to the last words of a youth
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
That the world is a book
====================
It will be gone by
====================
in the middle of the night
====================
I will not cease to breathe
====================
It is hard to think of the good woman
====================
When the moon finds them they are the color of everything
====================
Sort of strange in itself
====================
For the Anniversary of My Death
====================
I must go home
====================
I could say it was there and still
====================
for we shall meet again
====================
and a younger man walking on
====================
I grant you
====================
But as we went on
====================
And to the ends of the world
====================
Like the line of a dew
====================
Of sound no what is it I ask
====================
There I stood listening
====================
And the silence will set out
====================
still there
====================
I hope he stayed
====================
and they would smile; and another day
====================
Might it please God
====================

====================
and open to what we could do
====================
that we may all live to be the same color
====================
with no company
====================
and turned into a veil of darkness
====================
on the stairs they would all hear
====================
In time they would become the wall of the future
====================
The wells have fallen in and have fallen in and in
====================
with their families

particular note
====================
They let him nurse no worry; and behold he is gone
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
several lilies

of its yellow line it followeth

The nurses going past by their hats

you who are always changing

where the hollow

The Way to the River

Oh yellow stone and thunderbolt

as though I were saying something

With difficulty

Like ducks in the time of the ducks

Your devotion I have never imagined

The whale calves the black birds the pale

of them was the whole world

in the streetlight on each corner

with bells running among them

And his wife

And whose limbs were as white as the sea

which have already turned up before me

====================
and because the old one

When I go on

that are reflected in them but do not comprehend them

Some mornings I am waking up

which after all were history

without turning into words

where the shepherd went

But his wife
====================
in the last figures
====================
the yellow waterbugs lapping at the branches

If you would have me

As though I had a right to it

nearby villages

in Time

anywhere in the whole day
====================
And I know the way to the river
====================
and lose all recollection of what was said
====================
in the broad open sky
====================
at the end of the paper

Leaving behind her the bewilderment of her future
====================
the windows glass shut and the light

where I had not been

with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================
bodies clean and smooth as the faces of trees
====================
near the low stream under the moon
====================
to hear what they had to say
====================
Every time she drank
====================
with the tops of my feet echoing
====================
then I said
====================
as though I had recognized them all

====================
poverty
====================
dripping leaves below them
====================
Every time.
====================
for a long time I thought you had escaped

What are the hands

above which it falls

poverty

Unheard by us

No note of her tears.”
====================
Then the Time of My Death will come to pass

Ages I see them reflected not for long

====================
whenever I had the chance.”
====================
still
====================
and from there come back to us
====================
In December we are going to see
====================
and invented the old man's tongue
====================
and one of them came up behind me and started to play with hissing chickens
====================
In front of me they were building the empty
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
at times with his own eyes
====================
In a dream I bring you to this lovely valley
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
For speaking the truth
====================
With the ears about your neck
====================
and what is it
====================
it was
====================
that it remembered I carried it home
====================
as though it were a thing now and then and
====================
In the numbers
====================
is this a sense of home
====================
to listen
====================
which turned out to be a long way from here
====================
in our own time
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square
====================
that they should return to the shepherd
====================

====================

====================
as though they owned it
====================
Of water like a glass of water
====================
or at the sight of your wife
====================
What was the fox saying?
====================

====================
in the days of iron
====================
which I possess
====================
I have seen you at the poplars and at the presses
====================
Sort of

====================
the wind was blowing them both ways
====================
I lay my eyes on the sky
====================
Which parts
====================
and warden
====================
where one of them fell in and started from
====================
to the little church by the river one day there was a man in the street
====================
in the mountains where the blind men and the mute women were
====================
wandering on
====================
observances that could be expected
====================
and was sustained
====================
where my grandfather had gone
====================
* * *
====================
in the black of the night
====================
Dragged a dark mare into the field
====================
as though I recognized something in you
====================
in the highlands of the

====================
a hedgehog at the end of the lane
====================
If I saw you now I would say thank you
====================
not the whole story
====================
that silence to god
====================
But what if I was a man
====================
to the far side.
====================
and did not hear the sound
====================
where we were a young people
====================
without ever setting eyes on them
====================
and the wells they were built on
====================
with my whole face full of them
====================
And I've been to see
====================
and all the way down
====================
and without ever leaving them
====================
It is the hope of the unborn
====================
from the faces of our compatriots to the games of the world
====================
Like a paper lantern carried with it
====================
then he led them to the other side of the mountain
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
but we cannot escape it
====================
Now what will happen to me
====================
and we live in a world where hats are allowed in the house
====================
that they are all the same
====================
with names that go with it
====================
* * *
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
In the last breath
====================
yet they kept saying Come on over
====================
Though the old trees cry out in grief
====================
