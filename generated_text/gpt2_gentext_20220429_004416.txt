because it was born with

====================
and with them the dark
====================
I ask you to do the same
====================
even today my attention
====================
Gray as the sea
====================
The laundry baskets long afterward
====================
Consider what you will find in the black garden
====================
Consider this a blessing
====================
you who make the waves
====================
in the same month
====================
for the Anniversary of My Death
====================
in the moonlight that evening
====================
to breathe life into a body that he had invented
====================
and the bells stop
====================
after what I had been through
====================

====================

====================
these columns turned pale after midnight
====================
with little change
====================
little Hafiz there as in a garment
====================
where the gaps were long
====================
whether or not I noticed I turned around faster
====================
the way down
====================
The night the world was going to end
====================
and spoke that day
====================
and have carried on following its example
====================
Sort of funeral procession
====================
That
====================
who was St Vincent
====================
which I have learned
====================
we put on high boots to be ready
====================
still we might coax you with pebbles
====================
Thought of nothing I do not recall
====================
what I thought I had it
====================
with no door
====================
that all-consuming hunger stalks the wren
====================
a system of invisible order
====================
were binding upon her
====================
To the city of wires
====================
so we shall see
====================
whether that whole night
====================
to go on grieving over the cupidity
====================
Somewhere ahead of me
====================
for longer than a moment and for longer than I could comprehend
====================
the Stream of Friday
====================
or whatever it may be
====================
untouched
====================
pumping oxygen to the fires
====================
which is how they all heard me
====================
of what we are
====================
without being said a word
====================
Toward the End of Time
====================
from the journeys we have made
====================
after a while I forget
====================
of unknown life
====================
Consider now what I would do differently. Instead
====================
in a wagon with others
====================
Over the watercourses
====================
It will be broken when it is done
====================
and find myself in the last few days
====================
And we all lie motionless
====================
that had been the whole world
====================
If only we could make a new age
====================
Hearing
====================
Once we heard shelling the same over the field
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
the warden asked one day and I said yes
====================
in that old barn the animals would be
====================
of whatever it might be that it remembered
====================

====================
Then Thayer said
====================
even when they could no longer
====================
And if he said yes he would live
====================
Bread
====================
many years after the example of our forefathers
====================
Set me down; set me over
====================
of others who have followed as though they were stories
====================
And we who are few will not be
====================
I possess the heart of a fox
====================
Except for me
====================
That shall not come to the priest
====================
to the word black from the start
====================
and built his own
====================
Delve deeper into yourself and your feelings
====================
and thereby arrive at a good name
====================
You who are never the same
====================
lying motionless on their backs
====================
And Consolations
====================
which has shown me
====================
Shall be killed first?
====================
whose hands were full of presents
====================
I can hear the scratch and flare
====================
not looking where I was taking them
====================
And the days hang medals between us
====================

====================
That was the end of my court

====================
Far Company
====================

====================
but it is his life and his tears
====================
whether it is the sound of birds or the echoing
====================
That the world is a hollow frame
====================
I do not understand
====================
That strange design of yours which keeps on rising
====================
when the eyes started moving
====================
to the name that said
====================
Of ghosts waking from their slumber
====================
gutted in its silence
====================
We will never
====================
which ranged into the villages
====================
so they can see through
====================
which was the turning of autumn
====================
which the voice of the dove says
====================
That is what I was
====================
in the time of the bees
====================
Once upon a time I stood at the open door
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
and pave the sluiced rocks where they had set my footprints
====================
although it is my whole life that I have held as a truth
====================
all those years ago
====================
a. As if they'd all just noticed me
====================
with eyes that were wider and fatter
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
that summer
====================
Come with me
====================
and did not
====================
and the day will certainly come when I have filled the empty
====================
several children
====================
If anyone sees it he will have fallen into his mouth
====================
of these I write
====================
and we will learn to pray
====================
the clouds shewing
====================
To the bewilderment of the few
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
and from there we plunged into the ether
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
But knowing how

====================
I step over the gaps in the wall
====================
unheard by
====================
What will you one day
====================
Presenting you with children
====================
of water
====================
Of iron and bronze
====================
In the light the eyes have seen
====================

====================
left foot on rock
====================
I begin to hear birds singing
====================
we go on
====================
* * *
====================
we will never
====================
On the other hand it is perfectly possible that the extinct animals
====================
even after the names have changed
====================
The princesses made a poor meal
====================
wandering on
====================
which I know the names of
====================
with our mouths full of food
====================
the Death of
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
It is the surface that is getting lost
====================
and plunged into the dark
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
whatever you might have left
====================
the ways of the fox
====================
It all started with a kissing
====================
as if it had a whole life ahead of it
====================
Here come the flies of autumn and the burned-out church—that is to say, all the way down
====================
The whole sky
====================
having said that before we did anything
====================
than the years at the ends of the world
====================

====================
That at times strange and others familiar
====================
starting out in a different kind of life
====================
and as Hans took them in he
====================
invisible pasts
====================
in the time of the children I have
====================
and there he was
====================
to hear the scratch in their ears
====================
And made the stars of the sky
====================
bodies clean
====================
with my whole body around me
====================
of the watercourse
====================
Thanks to you we live
====================
At times now from some margin of the day
====================
The third day
====================
only the death sentences too brief
====================
then he led them to the other side of the mountain
====================
And when I went on thinking
====================
What is the tongue
====================
or that its night was
====================
Considering what it will take to bring about the present day
====================
with the head in the water
====================
* * *
====================
those silken clouds which overspread the green hills
====================
They said
====================
but his is my association
====================
Thanks</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For finding what you were looking for
====================
and made a bed
====================
And recall me
====================
I knew the way to the river
====================
even among the ragged forests
====================
With a little coaxing
====================
and the stars
====================
what we are
====================
* * *
====================
with the evergreen leaves
====================
even when I could no longer
====================
that has stayed with us
====================
kept secret from the folk who followed it
====================
a play on numbers
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
The tracks started out the other end
====================
bodies yellow in the daylight
====================
Sort of sweeping along the rim of the glass
====================
that they might hear
====================
That men would think of
====================
The hope
====================
weeds that were few then were standing in doorways
====================
The goats
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
But who is he
====================

====================
The strange lights
====================
he stood there staring at them all
====================
of the trees
====================
in a box that he carried with him
====================
betrayals so many
====================
the scars on the wall
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
said they would come to I do not
====================
I step over the sluiced rocks and mossy branches
====================
who are all familiar to us
====================
and I have said that before
====================
one of them we could do
====================
in the long afternoons
====================
across the lane from us we are all moving
====================
Presenting no risk to life or limb or body or door-to-door
====================
whenever that had been
====================
I keep hearing the same ragged note
====================

====================

====================
and be sustained
====================
in front of the IRT one end of the one
====================
and a whole city
====================
in Time
====================
There are those
====================
to the ends of the earth
====================
The way to the river leads to the sea
====================
Of Stream of Friday
====================
Invisible River
====================
that evening and all night long
====================
of flames the whole sky
====================
the dew is running clear across it
====================
and we will say thank you
====================
and the hollow
====================
without note
====================
If you please
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
and we are putting our faith in you
====================
with yellow slates
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
Of course we have to pretend for a living
====================
On the first day
====================
having wakened animals to hearing pain
====================
in the paper lane
====================
to me
====================
as though I had recognized them all
====================
That the Stream of Friday 
====================
far from here
====================
If it said Thank you
====================
wandering on
====================

====================
From now on I will look less closely
====================
which I have seen in the Trees
====================
When they are gone.
====================
in the middle of the night
====================
Like a blank paper
====================
to hear the scratch as it went on
====================
On the dark stairs there are no more
====================
No note of her tears;
====================
Of the extinct
====================
The blind men stopping at none to help them
====================

====================
at the feet of my father
====================
The helmets white with the sunlight
====================
Some words I may have said
====================
* * *
====================
Of all the autumn leaves the color of grass
====================
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
====================
That which is real this whole life
====================
of numbers one after the other
====================
for the hope they might come to the rescue of the dying
====================
Once I heard the faint hum of the wagon by
====================
and who is he?
====================
The clouds the nights shadows
====================
the wind was blowing the whole sky
====================
And the other time he spoke nothing at all
====================
and never to come back to this time
====================
after my retinas.
====================
Your shoes too small to help you
====================
the tongue glitters with geraniums
====================
Walking on
====================
somewhere where my father and my mother were born
====================
as though they were still children
====================
as though I owned it
====================
he was born in a country
====================
whose will the swallows believe
====================
and
====================
it follows from this that
====================
to a blind keeper who had just seen him
====================
of warden's shade to where I was standing
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
partly for myself
====================
I hear the scratch and feel the scratch
====================
nothing at all
====================
are stretched asunder
====================
In September there is but little else
====================
Unheard by
====================
oh Perdita
====================
Then the cry of the dead
====================
and put the dew back on the eyes of the dead
====================
Thinking over what to do with the old man
====================
with its own set of eyes
====================
whether or not to look
====================
in the seed-huts
====================
Once I heard someone say
====================
Whose is the shepherd
====================
that the tongue could comprehend
====================
The blood has shown the scars of the future
====================
to whom I said
====================
in a river
====================
invisible before them
====================
but that which is open and keeps to itself
====================
where there were no questions
====================
that rang and glowed like a lantern
====================
or made with what little was left
====================
in the shadow of the big poplar tree
====================
whether they like it or not,
====================
It is not to be alarmed
====================
in time they came to me
====================
It may be so, but it is the irreplaceable thing for us to old age
====================
without hiding the true color
====================
I know where I am
====================
all this after the way had turned and before the stars had lit
====================
Catch the flare and fire
====================
have you?
====================
of water
====================
Consider what you will find in the garden
====================
those pale helmets
====================
you who arrive
====================
Will there come the dead to’

====================
to the hush of the early morning
====================
What are the feet
====================

====================
In time they will all be dead
====================
were carried out in front of the open windows
====================
as though I recognized them all
====================
appear to be saying nothing
====================
And that this secret life of ours might be complete
====================
Cable said
====================
which were made of paper
====================
In the same city I was born
====================
that he had learned with his own eyes
====================

====================
when I was young and
====================
whenever that
====================
and to have been born of it
====================
and the names of the animals
====================
I know it to be the sound of you
====================
I assumed you'd arrive somewhere
====================
I bring you along with me
====================
that part that goes on down
====================
Far Company
====================
And the mornings he is silent
====================
A French word for cloth
====================
when we go on
====================
The numbers wait in the halls of power
====================
and are sustained by their tears
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
====================
Winding along our inner mountains
====================
whom I never saw nor heard
====================
Hearing
====================
you who are new to me
====================
We do not recall
====================
You would never imagine how small a world such a populous city
====================
with one end I could see
====================
I see
====================
no help from above
====================
with its chimneys setting out white birds of the same color
====================
And a little to the left
====================
of what soliloquy I could say
====================
I took a tin cup and climbed’salks’
====================
then the tongue said to me
====================
not the company at all
====================
out of the blue and without understanding
====================
beside the moon that she had seen
====================
When I think back 
====================
when the coming of the kites
====================
and the things that are forgotten
====================
so it falls
====================
having borne with her
====================
pale and the beatings
====================
nothing unusual
====================
But Necessity Buries
====================
these shapes made in the future
====================
they turned into hedgerows
====================
and stayed
====================
Hiding
====================
What will she do now
====================
yet each with its place
====================
[Outgoing Fedose
====================
For though I could remember
====================
which was my little country I could
====================
Fingered hat-felt
====================

====================
in which the singing stopped and the wind picked up and there were
====================
I let you in as often as I can
====================
they kept saying Come on over
====================
Hearing not of those things who would come to haunt them
====================
heard of it
====================
with nobody seeing them but themselves
====================
Of everything the sea has shown me
====================
Then the song ends and the sky is singing
====================
and it is in the speech that I hears it
====================
For when the hollows become populous
====================
which we are said to have learned
====================
unheard by
====================
as though it had all happened in a few sentences
====================
you will hear me
====================
Every time they learn
====================
with good news
====================
Cries all afternoon.”
====================
The clouds the nights the days
====================
yet they are as long as the eye sees
====================
It was made of paper.
====================
That the hired hands help them
====================
which they make of tin
====================
those nights the pastors were to become more intimate
====================
* * *
====================
poverty
====================
Your eyes I know
====================
we put on high boots to be ready
====================
where it stood.
====================
after which they would go on living
====================
and through it I come to the little star
====================
you were born to hold such a thing
====================
as I turned away from them
====================
that they were made of sandpaper
====================
you will see
====================
still the long summer
====================
If we knew we would do something about it
====================
on the wide river
====================
we made bridges
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
and we will do without you
====================
I know how to carry it
====================
And before the river could turn.

====================
and I will uncover my folds
====================
with a scoring
====================
which we would all like to end with a kiss</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
but we cannot Do It Right
====================
and this time the children
====================
That they may know you
====================
in the right places at the right time
====================
On the bridge where the shadow fell
====================
and upon their backs plowing through without even listening
====================
staring down from the gallery
====================
of knowledge
====================
Among the stones he saw a fox lying
====================
hanging or lying
====================
While there
====================
Hearing
====================
and there they were
====================
and in the name of the river
====================
Which letters the days hang on
====================
To the bewilderment of time
====================
and the horizon
====================
that they might learn from it
====================
I've seen her do with iron
====================
who live by the river
====================
I catch sight of him turning away<
====================
Now go on
====================
The hired man does not
====================
in the black of the night and nobody is looking
====================
exploded into many containers
====================
untouched for
====================
sometimes with a little trepidation
====================
of iron and steel they ranged many feet away
====================
these things I have seen and heard
====================
Now for the bells
====================
or


====================
You have no familiar place among them
====================
and my mother
====================
without saying a word
====================
Like many windows in a gallery
====================
or had heard them before
====================
those harbors
====================
In winter there is not a day gone by that does not come to know
====================
once one day there were all the same digits
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
At times it is even I forget
====================
with a young person
====================
I open the door
====================
and set out on a different course
====================
they all knew it was there
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
far from here
====================

====================
still the days of iron
====================
I hope he will find something to do
====================
as though it were my own body
====================
Oh juggler
====================
unheard by
====================
with our own eyes we are saying thank you
====================
although no longer ashamed of it
====================
Poverty
====================
the silence to day
====================

====================
and the echoing
====================
For longer than by now I can believe
====================
that we might nurse
====================
which the eyes did not see
====================
as a field of stars
====================
What is the tongue
====================
Sort of empty tomorrow
====================
the line turned green by morning
====================
kept secret from the people
====================

====================
the black hollow where there were no marks
====================

====================
that they were assembled
====================
Ahead of us
====================
To each other
====================
* * *
====================
poverty
====================
Of the fairy tales that led them
====================
Unheard by us
====================
Bread
====================
where it was my turn to be forgotten
====================
And a little while longer
====================
With hands I could carry it.
====================
And Cable said
====================
several of the windows looking out in a>

====================
All these years we were small
====================
And the days hang medals between us
====================
as far from your own eyes as possible
====================
and I would return to the square
====================
somewhere where I was born
====================
of the empty
====================
that are lit out on the wall with letters A through R have no more 
====================
It is a strange color that grows on me
====================
still the days of iron
====================
Cries all afternoon.”
====================
and all the while listening
====================
In times past I imagined myself standing
====================
for the little things that are important
====================
then warden Cable said
====================
that they might be ritually sustained
====================
Which tongue does it know
====================
whom I consider my father
====================
not a strand of hair but a strand of sunlight
====================
to carry on speaking
====================
whether it be at home or abroad
====================
Might as well have stayed
====================
the horizon grew wider
====================
thank you
====================
in the last days of the world
====================
And I have seen him with bewilderment
====================
they waked and ranged and dealt in packs
====================
whether they be the goats, the sheep, or the asses
====================
which I might have learned from
====================
who is a
====================
not allowed to do it over
====================
And I have seen her only as a shadow
====================
There were the goats and the calves
====================
with those small openings in the wall
====================
What was he I asked what was he
====================
in a frame by the glass house
====================
and
====================
Every time
====================
The bells stalling
====================
appears in the papers the size of our hand
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
I step over the sleepers the fires the calendars
====================
although we might have imagined them to comprehend
====================
The bells stalling
====================
as though I recognized them all
====================
I consider my whole life beyond measure
====================
Grows colder and it is we’s-

====================
but it falls upon the men of the woods,

the men

of wheat and the men of

the field of

<|startoftext|>
the color of the shadow

Is the sound of the dead scraping

On the floor and hearses

<|startoftext|>lying on their backs with their mouths wide open
====================
said to my father
====================
on the black surface
====================
In the wrong hands
====================
* * *
====================
It was a wooden box
====================
for the Anniversary of My Death
====================
poverty
====================
whether as children they learn little
====================
and held them
====================
No what is that
====================
That you must have imagined me
====================
To the beautiful valley where the rocks rose and fell
====================
when they had imagined me
====================
What I thought I had left I kept finding again
====================
the starlight glitters from its own journeys
====================
to hear step after step the sound of building dust

were almost to die of sorrow
====================
At times he was whole’s body
====================
and I would have told you so if only. Instead, as though it had a right to more, he consigned it to time.
====================
We are the forests
====================
invisible before us
====================
Neither my father nor my mother
====================
and his wife’s tongue’s in her own
====================
I find it impossible to think of the good person
====================
The boat-men were assembled on either side of the wide screen and the old man started from the beginning
====================
And break up into smaller pieces

”Cable

with one end already gone

left foot on a rock in the water
====================
weeds
====================
in time they came to a clear floor
====================
with the whale calves neck for neck
====================
out of the kindness of my parents
====================
Like a calendar in one color.
====================
Thinking of the men who would go away hungry
====================
That is how I have come to it
====================
in a day they are an order of magnitude smaller</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>than the last time around
====================
with the help of a big stick I was able to
====================
From my youth till today
====================
when they turned to the far side

I know how to listen

you possess

Considering that you may be smaller and your numbers smaller

of tenderness which escapes our eyes

It is not there in the same city

those dark footprints

If only I could be a little younger

Of the dreams I had

there is that other there is the whole body
====================
the tracks started out the eyes
====================
|
====================
of iron; of bronze they wear it not; and the shadows
====================
that it know not
====================
which I have seen and read
====================
They would be the color of the morning
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
whether painted yellow, green, red or whatever
====================

====================
from the brief notes of my tongue
====================
than sight nor sound
====================
and grant their blessing
====================
in the same city
====================
that have been brought to me
====================
Where I was a boy the sight made me forget
====================
those forests far above
====================
as though it were an old friend
====================
The color.
====================
which I comprehended with fairity
====================
easing past poplars on the hills
====================
Are made of your blood
====================
If the wind was not a hindrance
====================
Cable said
====================
in the same time zone
====================
that they would come to the same thing
====================
When they are gone but a shadow
====================
these gloves he had brought with him
====================
and thereby the starlight has gone out of my life
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
and in the end nobody could say what had happened
====================
and he spoke with an unknown voice
====================
* * *
====================
as one with the familiar bricks of that new house
====================
What I thought I had left
====================
you will meet me
====================
of clouds of smoke rising from the top
====================
The quills are what get me
====================
Asking what shall I say
====================
with no shade
====================
I wear the sleeve of my coat as an old man does usages
====================
as though they were still alive in full

====================
to the pale one
====================
our clouds
====================
then I answered: your father’s
====================
of perfections
====================
of moonlight the color of dust
====================
long after all the others had gone on
====================
observances
====================
whom I never saw or heard and for whom I did not know
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
near the mouths of the trees
====================
The rivers one
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
than the last word
====================
bodies clean and smooth as branches
====================
in whose time the word was a name
====================
which they all spoke with 
====================
Consider what you will find
====================
Over the watercourses
====================
or a name
====================
exploded into shapes and sizes and shapes and sizes
====================
that sire
====================
for the hearing mouth to open
====================
No body but the shadow
====================
with the train sweeping the broad leaves
====================
While the hollows rose in the morning and the late millenarian stretched before them
====================
at the feet of my father
====================
those who lived and died by the Stream of Friday
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
That they did not know they were caught
====================

====================
I shuffle among the lies
====================
which started the night
====================
it comes with me
====================
in the mornings I would have thought so
====================
It seems as though we were always on our own
====================
And the nights disappear like bruises
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
as though I had known them all already
====================
I hope they never look back
====================
those who did not bow before her
====================
It is there in me
====================
and tears were running down her face as she thought
====================
In the dark
====================
With my whole body I see
====================
the faces of the men
====================
Bread
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
still we can hear the scratch and flare
====================
It is a strange thing for me to possess
====================
With no father
====================
nothing broken or lost
====================
The wide river leads down hollow
====================
that was the turning of autumn
====================
What I thought I would find in them
====================
and the twilight when the light will say yes
====================
A white whale approached from the far side of the globe
====================
said,

====================
and without
====================
He was old he is not real nothing is real
====================
those names he turned to me
====================
|
====================
without their help it could have gone on
====================
In time they will all be dead
====================
said to me
====================
and that he would cry out when the world was about to him
====================
On the first day of summer
====================
I lay my eyes on the sky
====================
Grows smaller by the shuffle
====================
and the wells have fallen in and have sown season
====================
If we could do it all
====================
you who are new to the world
====================
in another I begin to know what I am
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
in a house
====================
what was I
====================
Now set eyes on me
====================
you who arrive
====================
lying or lying
====================
I took my eyes
====================
with a few poplars to match
====================
but the eyes stayed on me
====================
then the Stream of Friday
====================
For those who will
====================
to the names of
====================
without knowing it
====================
and remembered me
====================
Of anonymous water
====================
in the calendar or in any other credible system
====================
as though I recognized something in them
====================
from my whole life I have known it to be a noise
====================
all the way north on the train to St Vincent’s Hospital
====================
The Great Sleep
====================

====================
of them all the way up to the sky
====================
Have a merry little breakf*ckup
====================
in the wide grass waving as far away
====================
and has for a time given way
====================
in time they came to me
====================
What is the tongue
====================
There are those among us who are not ashamed of age
====================
In the name of the Stream of Friday
====================
that is to say disappeared forever from my sight
====================
in a black coat and emerge with the medals
====================
Now save those words for the end
====================
having said this before I return
====================
Some days when it is not here
====================
To be there; it is there
====================
in the same day
====================

====================
And my blessing is on me to the wall
====================
On the wide river
====================
It was there that I started to know
====================
and both
====================
The faces
====================
in the footsteps I have come to carry you
====================
those who walk in them
====================

====================
Leaving behind him the pale city
====================
When you are gone
====================
who make no sound
====================
To the far side.
====================
which lies somewhere between
====================
in the boots and after the while
====================
the warden stood looking out of the window
====================
The fires have fallen and the road 
====================
but it escapes its attention
====================
to die
====================
and this time I beat the heck out of him
====================
and a little bit of everything
====================
and whose names I can scarcely remember
====================
The bridges will clutch in the late sills
====================

====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
as though I recognized them all
====================
turned into a tongue
====================
Or at the very least hear yourself to say what you are feeling
====================
several maids go into the room and listen
====================
than the days of iron
====================
What if my brother or my father had not gone away to the woods to find a needle
====================
and we humbly bow to you
====================
and after the fashion of that valley
====================
The old man spat on the floor and the pile
====================
and hang
====================
and ride on through the evening
====================
observances long after sacrifices
====================
but never with the voice going back
====================
That one sound
====================
I took the long way home
====================
Though we are told not to see it we are to blame
====================
the sleep of the eyes
====================
Invisible men
====================
whether for work by yourself or as a kind of mirror
====================
the note held up like a glove by the hand
====================
And I know the tears are falling
====================
They said
====================
and
====================
from the black of the night to the full moonlit day
====================
Set me by your hands
====================
he asked me how he was feeling
====================
many years ago when I was young
====================
Far Company
====================
and the wilde dreams of the extinct
====================
It has gone away and is sleeping
====================
far from here
====================
and learned thereby
====================
This is life
====================
Just like a star or a thing
====================
that they might as well possess
====================
Of iron and steel
====================
and the days of iron
====================
with eyes that are as old as the light
====================
The others will know
====================
it is the whole world
====================
Each with its own sense of place and time
====================
which had come at last from the Stream of Friday
====================
from the same boat;
====================
all over again
====================
for the names that were to appear in them
====================
as though they had first seen it



====================
of this body
====================
of every color
====================
Once we turned from the Stream of Friday
====================
Gray as the sea
====================
on the door next morning
====================
so I turned to the right and parked the car
====================
about to say a name
====================
it escapes its garments it flies into the brain of a dying man
====================
and ride with you
====================
whether it be music, a sense of belonging or simply a feeling remains
====================
Into the fire
====================
of the accidents the knowledge fades into the background
====================
The hollow Stream of Friday
====================
I asked once
====================
arranged the corpses of animals
====================

====================
somewhere where I was born
====================
and the late drifter has raised his voice
====================
who live among us
====================
where we had not come
====================
I will never forget you
====================
what a screen|
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
====================
in them all they are neither
====================
so this is the place to get together and have a bit of fun
====================
as though they had known what it was and what it meant
====================
You have set me free of the body of the fox
====================
From the pile of bricks to the screen door
====================
which will open again when I have filled
====================
in my sleep they kept saying Come on over
====================
untouched
====================
And sleep
====================
although they are small in the hand and in the pockets I have

====================
many lives ago I stood on a rock where you could see me
====================
whether we like it or not it's a problem we have to face up to
====================
one will see
====================
it is moving
====================
you said before the river had gone down
====================
and his wife and his dog and his ape-cat and his lost sheep and all the while tracking his lost forever
====================
never the same never caught while through the small leaves
====================
unheard by
====================
these streets were built on
====================
out of charity
====================
Like a whole Sunday of bells. ”
====================

====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
then came down from the trees from whom I had come
====================
the road to prosperity
====================
Now let me
====================
That is his name he tells you
====================
on the stairs they would all appear familiar
====================
although I have no acquaintance with their minds
====================
and would have given them the moment
====================
Like mice past and present;
====================
Cable said
====================
In the heat of the moment I remembered
====================
or if you please leave a note
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
the windows of old windows
====================
and told him
====================
Asking what shall I say
====================
He was a son of a shepherd
====================
to hear them all over again
====================
and the sirens wailing
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
that dark but important door
====================
it was a small thing
====================
As though I had a right to it I took it away I knew it to be a right
====================
there by the Stream of Friday
====================
and the days of iron
====================
In autumn I open the sleeves of my gloves of blood
====================
of the dead
====================
pumping oxygen to the old man
====================
I've been to see
====================
those eyes wide with white where the back of the hand
====================
Walking on bread
====================
And after all the whispering and the broken promises
====================
these relics
====================
said
====================
what if</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I could be sure what I would find in the world
====================
and oh Cable the Cable the Night Sweats the Stamps
====================
Everywhere I was born
====================
For the corpses of the parents
====================
each other through the night
====================
whether it be from the sense of place or the feeling of belonging
====================
dripping leaves and
====================
or something like that
====================
as long as I live
====================
to hear the wind listen
====================
With whom I stood
====================
which are set apart for themselves by numbers
====================
that they had forgotten
====================
arranged the corpses of animals
====================
Thought of my own body
====================

====================
of shining life
====================
from the womb to the little star
====================
On the night of the lightning
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
and studied without comment
====================
but that it might be filled with wonder and satisfaction
====================
no sound
====================
With a straight face
====================
Might as well get out of here
====================
What is a stir
====================
Into a wagon filled with wheat and onions and furs and rubbes and mare pens and rubbings and drags—oh the multitude
====================
but I have no such key
====================
that morning the column was shaking with the rain
====================
and now I go on
====================
then they would turn to back in
====================
thank you
====================
no noise
====================
partly for the faith in you
====================
I could feel it in my tongue
====================
The wild ducks the size of trucks
====================
Unheard by us
====================
Then the shadows cease
====================
it glitters like a city in the distance
====================
you will find that no creature you will ever know has already died
====================
and look upward
====================
that they should say a name like
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
it was
====================
which we might have coaxed you with pebbles
====================
he who was|
====================
Which were made of stone
====================
I shuffle among the lies
====================

====================

====================
the flags of the extinct
====================
beside all the years of my life
====================
What was the fruit called
====================
you go on rising
====================
whose body and who were buried
====================
We are the door-machines of the future
====================
as though they were still alive in full of themselves
====================
on what roof did I have
====================
Just because it may
====================
or tapes?
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
they said thank you for waking them all
====================
Far Company
====================
I took it as granted as

====================
wandering on
====================
