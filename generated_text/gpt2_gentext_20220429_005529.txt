====================
with its fitted coat flickering yellow

At times they were kinder to visitors
====================
whereof I lay my mind
====================
in the stalks that lean slightly toward the sunlight
====================
To the city of wires
====================
of the countless

When I went away looking
====================
then go on
====================
without recognising it as such and ending up as a normal person
====================
unjustly condemned after

Oh white lakes;
====================
shadows over the land

When I
====================
that they would escape
====================
and carried on with the day
====================
To the deathly door That its hinges push open And its lingering light Streams on
====================
with yellow beads on them
====================
to the door-to-door of our own family
====================
that dark line between satire and boorishness
====================
not for long
====================
To the Light of September
====================
Your eyes
====================
but the passers-by seem less acquaintanceable
====================
in the vast open sky
====================
once in the same life
====================
in the forests
====================
I've had a long look at someone
====================
Asking what shall I say
====================
and this time it was the drunkard
====================
untouched
====================
in the broad daylight
====================
you who make the stars of bone

* * *
====================
you are familiar to me
====================
who lives by the stream

Will they be free of me
====================
and
====================

====================
several neo-classic cabanas frame the other end
====================
but we cannot see
====================
That they have forgotten
====================
pale and worn-out
====================
not the whole story but a brief summary
====================
What I would have given to live
====================
Winding along your inner mountains

were what they were
====================
Catch fire and return fire
====================
on the rocks above where I had been
====================
and the Doors
====================
those who shuffle without shuffle
====================

====================
Of how the wells were made
====================
That the stars do not see
====================
a blind man carried her to safety
====================
or from the folds of my garment
====================
then one day they were all healed of the wounds they had sustained and of the lies they had told
====================
or your old flame
====================
Sort of New Year
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall that had just stoodin
====================
Came a fox to scratch the grass
====================
to the oaks they were pasture
====================
You could hear the scratch
====================
in the forests the flashing lights
====================
Then I will no longer
====================
a sibyl of the same age and the same place born from the same seed

To the Winter Palace
====================
after each of them

to be sustained

Grows colder and the noose starts to tighten

====================
and we have the ghosts of the villages

what if the lightning had not shown’s me

from a single day

in those days we would find ourselves

Hearing

What are the feet

and wait

Who are the compatriots

Which of my many incomprehensions

in the wrong order

And the numbers the same

with no house on it part way out there

unheard by

Sort of out of left field

of wisdom

you look upward through

And bring him home to us

a plane of white sand

when they saw it reflected on the body

As we walked on

To the mute man and the mute woman</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
To the

in front of me and I could hear the scratch and flare
====================
to the sound of it all
====================
a good life
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
Whom I never knew
====================
not recognising the features of the person
====================
which I might have learned from

and if the lights go out and it isn't it it goes on

====================
For it is what is dear to us
====================
that they may know them better than from the things they say

Oh Blankom
====================
we would all be dead
====================
in the same city
====================
And try again tomorrow
====================
many lives ago I stood before a cross’sage’s house’sfire’s glass tower’s
====================
and the oysters and bells
====================
And hang
====================
that morning they assembled in the open courtyard
====================
The margin of his shadow
====================
in the forests
====================
Doing what you are told to do
====================
Far Company
====================
I took a tin cup and climbed’salks’
====================
To be a shepherd

He was old he is the fabric of the earth
====================

====================
and I have seen her often enough
====================
then stood me looking up and down
====================
as though I recognized them all
====================
who go out into the world
====================
The hands
====================
I know the design
====================
Alone like a key in a lock
====================
But it is he who is the hedgehog
====================
in other words what I am I ask you to do
====================
in the sluiced water they said thank you
====================
and with them his body
====================
whether it is the eloquence of the passers-by or the chill patience of the officials
====================
I've heard tales about mice and wolves
====================
whether we like it or not it is still we who are to become small farmers
====================
whose design was the exploitation of the earth
====================
somewhere in the daylight
====================

====================
what if we could do the same
====================
that has fallen into its own time; it’s
====================
whether it be at home or with a friend
====================
Whose is his weal
====================
Your death ours
====================
never the same never caught while through the small leaves
====================
not in the old days when I was a boy
====================
but it was Cable who first called
====================
and I have seen her with old age

The flags of Germany

all that is left is the world

of its own accord
====================
Except for the wind.”
====================
Once again I was there and once again I was leaving
====================
and the hollow echoing
====================
What for
====================
For Wendell Berry
====================
in the hollow
====================
particular shade would fall with the dying
====================
out of a wisdom I never knew
====================
the same vision over and over
====================
whenever I went away like a light at the end of the rainbow
====================
then Cable said to Thorgmich
====================
what is it
====================
in the Street
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
a green sky
====================
the nights of despair
====================
whether they be the eyes of a father
====================
I suppose it was that I held

I go on looking
====================
kept secret from the authorities

a river of blood the size of your foot
====================
of everything else I've learned
====================
That he would comprehend

I offer you my life
====================
and never the same never the same
====================
that are to say nothing of the Twenties
====================
In the rain forests they saw everywhere men lying in wait
====================
who lived the life of tales
====================
with the difference in the color of his skin
====================
who made the stars last
====================
white birds flying like laundry
====================
out of charity
====================
and if you will excuse my voice
====================
Small birds by the trees I hear
====================
While you are sleeping
====================
whenever we were that far away
====================
you who are new to it
====================
without the company of my friends
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
in the day I studied
====================
I could feel it in my tongue
====================
whom I would have recognized’s voice
====================
That the woods are his company
====================
then from them I emerge;
====================
and did not know him
====================
observances were carried on without cease
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
The forests have fallen in with the days of iron
====================
I put the key between my fingers
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
those nights I thought I had a future
====================
the line grew longer
====================
What are the hands
====================

====================
lying
====================
as though I had recognized them all already
====================
heard stories about the dark ponds
====================
in the same city
====================
They said thank you but never once to my voice
====================
so it is I stand
====================
in a straight line down the middle
====================
everywhere
====================
Brim over with water
====================
whenever my father asked
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
You could almost hear the engine go on
====================
out of the normal world
====================
on a warm autumn's day
====================
of thin air
====================
that rank youth will not his
====================
in the middle of afternoon
====================
The hollow
====================
The mountains it is the valleys its the turns of men's hands
====================
with no note of their own
====================
In another city
====================
that they may be sustained
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
====================
I lay my eyes on the sky
====================
On the wide river
====================

====================
while I copied the same design
====================
Men think they are better than grass
====================
still he is a whale
====================
in the same breath
====================
The way to the river leads north through the ivy;
====================
I know what I'd do without you
====================
oh Perdita
====================
each creature with its own set of eyes

====================
and was listening
====================
far from here
====================
from the ring to the mouth of the cave
====================
and certainly we are to believe that we are striking up a life
====================
All night long
====================
and we have held them with our hands
====================
with no acquaintance
====================
whether from their own free will
====================
that they knew not what they were doing
====================
Whose house will he find
====================
The helmets the kibitzes
====================
or whatever you had your hand in
====================
that they may come to the remembrance of
====================
What is the tongue
====================
To the Last River
====================
where the hollows are
====================
whether by design
====================
once upon a time I was travelling in a different time zone
====================
The late
====================
When I go on
====================
who made the stars shine by their own star
====================
He dreamed of waking up in the same day
====================
Far from here
====================
Of everything I have seen in the glass
====================
I was the one to ask
====================
in the fur or the feathers?
====================
whether we like it or not it is perfectly fair
====================
Which I have heard before;
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
which were carved for animals
====================
to each other and with
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
whether the old man is talking or not
====================
what a warden the mice are about
====================
although I can see nobody else does I
====================
who come with them and did not advance past the turns that led them
====================
Hearing
====================
with the sleeves torn asunder and the faces painted in moss
====================
what if
====================
What is the tongue
====================
when I turned
====================
who are the whole families
====================
that they are nothing if anything nearer to the true God
====================
and the glories of antiquity
====================

====================
where the nights were few and the clouds the sky
====================
the hollow
====================
when they went on
====================
No what are the feet
====================
full of their ignorance
====================
who write after the time
====================
long after my own eyes
====================
which were assembled without comment and without looking
====================
Whose and
====================
then they would not see
====================
to the Light of September
====================
untouched
====================
in a field away
====================
and said
====================
Or the sound of my own voice
====================
dripping leaves across the room
====================
In a field away I can hear the warden saying
====================
Whose is his is
====================
Unheard by us
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
Are there trees whose branches have never seen them
====================
While you are at it
====================
where the seasons were not in the same month
====================
With the seasons drawing to a close
====================
And the days of iron rule us all
====================
looking down at the tops of the trees
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
as a whole body part
====================
a phrase I hear all the time
====================
The gorges long live the bald heads
====================
of Night Stream
====================
long after the fashion of their age
====================
Except in the last of the late
====================
Nor the echo when I went on
====================
where we came from
====================
it is what it is
====================
few wells stacked
====================
out of the blue I hear a voice saying something to the effect
====================
Every time.
====================
(Like a mirror through the daylight
====================
but have you
====================
with no sign of how it might turn out
====================
I thank you
====================
Needing no other
====================
with whom I spoke less and less often?
====================
somewhere where we were born
====================
with my whole life ahead of me
====================
then the whispering birds
====================
And the nails the wreaths of the earth
====================
It seems from the moment I became aware that anyone
====================
Walls of silence
====================
said to have been made of it all
====================
as though they were still children
====================
were full of themselves and were about to go on
====================

====================
in the end there was nothing left
====================
said to myself; they are the accidents of my ways
====================
Which hair my eyes
====================
many years ago while I was away
====================
even today I can hardly believe what I am hearing
====================
In the lily pads
====================
them too I see
====================
And its engine silent
====================
on another day
====================
What if we could
====================

====================
not a word they are learning to pray
====================
whether from a selfish heart or from the will of the few
====================
in time the voices of the men have fallen silent
====================
I have seen him with eyes blue as fluttering as midnight
====================
observances as shepherd sibyls
====================
hanging mightily on my
====================
to be sustained by its dark breath
====================
a name
====================
From eyes that were old they could see
====================
you never noticed on the road
====================
which escapes our comprehension
====================
Far and rheumy with years
====================
Now
====================
when it came to me
====================
That my word
====================
Far Company
====================
Now be here what shall I do
====================
If only he knew how to nurse a baby boy
====================
and buy a tin please tell me
====================
and I had imagined you somewhere
====================
with no house on it now and then
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
with them I step away from the chain of command
====================
In the heat and lightning
====================
and though they were never like this they were certainly not what I had imagined they were
====================
It is a garment my feet are
====================

====================
Considering what you will of nothing’s will of it’s own life
====================
I wear a torn place on my sleeve
====================
From the star-crossed valleys
====================
although they may be the marks of a long life
====================
not my thing to cry;
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
without which my whole body was destroyed
====================
in the folds
====================
who are we to comprehend
====================
That is the rank house
====================
Far Company
====================
Dutifully waiting
====================
then we set out with our lives
====================
And we learn that we are still
====================
observances
====================
and it troubles me that anyone would do it
====================
a marriage of blood
====================
Your wife
====================
after one of the late lit fires
====================
and after the names
====================
At times they are everywhere
====================
The names too small to remember
====================
The plane came to a stop and the old man said 
====================
as long as they stayed with me
====================
Of shepherd stars

Jailed in himself

Loss of Consciousness

Hearing

unheard by us

In the same city I was born

the way to the river leads past your single thought

then with a little charity I might have yielded

<|startoftext|>Back at evening drunk with indecision and vices and vices

those who are older and who are not

Will the wind hear me

after the name has forgotten and is sleeping

these have been offered me

have you heard of them

wandering on

somewhere in the light the true hunger

I know

To the Last Trees

We are old men milling about

many lives ago I stood where you are standing

And Cable the Consolable
====================
nothing at the time and now she

So long as I live

And from that hour on we learned to pray
====================
of what might have been

I took my eyes

that is to say, stood there staring up at the sky
====================
with no acquaintance
====================
and a blind woman
====================
in the twisted warden's garden
====================
of countless names that had gone before us
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
Set me on a slope
====================
the noise of the dead
====================
With unquenchable hunger

they keep saying Come on over

and the future

====================
Do not look where I am

invisible at the top of every

in the clouds

what a change the men have made

untouched
====================
the scars on the wall

They say the story of Christmas is one of it

and a little bit too late for the day.

I would have thought that you would have turned out the way I did

which one of us has it

wandering on

oh Perdita

then rose again;

as though I were there and to see

I carry you

It is how I have come to it

as though it were a system

each shade of blue

they said thank you

mustard ketchup onions and relish

in the hollow

where it was not there

The bewilderment with no end

in the field after sunrise

yet they all seem to be accomplishing the same thing

nothing at all

With the bells channelling thunder in the chill ground

weeds

Will the bleeding cease and the lamentations live on

you will not hear me

The eyes started from my own

whether it be from the long lingering

and the harbors

And we see now what would be the fate of the family

Of late they have taught

I take them as granted as I can

out of charity

”When you are gone.”
====================
Here comes the old woman
====================
and did not hear
====================
What is the tongue
====================
and once again we were living where we were proud
====================
To the Light of September
====================
a trail to the stars
====================
in the box on the top floor there were nooses in it
====================
then he turned and started to walk
====================
full of the waiting of their footprints
====================
The mouths of the mice
====================
which ranged for days over at half-full
====================
even now my mother hears
====================
one last time
====================
They said to myself oh by the Stream of Friday
====================
While the hearts of the dead rise above
====================
we put them up for display
====================
with no house on it there on the floor there was nothing
====================
so that they might bequeath them
====================
weeds
====================
They said thank you but it comes at a time when we all have
====================
in this color
====================
And hush the dew is falling on the true city
====================
pumping oxygen to the old woman
====================
whether baked goods such as bells or stalks
====================
The bells stop and the voices of the men grow smaller

several Ovid stories
====================
Every time she took note

Hearing

and held him for

and
====================
whenever I went to church

the ghosts of old times

and handed them over

If I were a human being
====================
to hear step after step explain to him

Far Company
====================
In the name of the unborn
====================
you will never find
====================
So I take it it is the head I am looking for
====================
it was there at hand
====================
a kind of humility that sees through the lies
====================
and we all die
====================
which are what I am
====================
It is the turning of autumn in the country
====================
One great god
====================
as long as I looked
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
and to bequeath him
====================
a strand of sky that they knew as the
====================
Surprised at your skin
====================
that the tongue could hear
====================
as though I owned it
====================
the hedgerows
====================
and I have seen
====================
Are there forests to be found in the hills
====================
For the one who loves you
====================
and
====================
that they never saw coming
====================
From what I could tell the place was simply beyond her comprehension
====================
So let me’sGoose’
====================
heard your wren Singing When the violets came running Last Night I Sleep

not without risk

The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky

So at last I hear the doorbell ring
====================
a year ago this year
====================
somewhere in the light the true color
====================
Which tongue did she hear warden
====================
In a fox's fur
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
those who were not
====================
which were made of the few
====================
And quench the thirst
====================
near the mouth of the valley
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
the bewilderment of waking
====================
and I have seen her with amazement
====================
than with a hundred questions
====================
you lay your hand on it
====================
kept secret from the people
====================
but they would all be dead before they could be heard
====================
in the wrong places at the wrong time
====================
whether as families
====================
as though they had known me whole life
====================
and set about building upon them
====================
Was there anything I could do?
====================
with the word going out like a sound system
====================
yet we all know what to do
====================
in a cab by the river one night
====================
I'm learning
====================
and we are stopping before them all
====================
The hollow halls full of the dead
====================
of what little liveliness
====================
with them we are marching
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
You would think you had come to a time like that which the sea has forgotten
====================
as if it had a right to more
====================
turned pale and thundering and clanging outside
====================
But the word
====================
Hearing
====================
Far Company
====================
in that rainless summer that burned my hair as a seed
====================
in Time
====================
as though they had known me then
====================
Oh creature of the forests
====================
and the Animals
====================
and held in their hands
====================
you will find nothing among them but silence
====================
whenever they saw it happening
====================
many lives ago they might have paused for a moment to consider
====================
you would believe that you were still alive
====================
to be sustained
====================
which it is I choose to live by
====================
it is for the accidents
====================
these footprints
====================
to the door that it had open
====================
and a Blank Night
====================
and this time I answered they ranged
====================
exploded into shapes
====================
The hedgehog
====================
to hear their troubles through to the
====================
out of nowhere a beam of light telepathically guiding her
====================
The hired man does not seem to see it
====================
then said I
====================
and the nights hang afterward in the unhappy memories
====================
whenever that had been
====================
and his wife as they grew old
====================
for myself alone
====================
where I have not been
====================
Who are the compatriots
====================
whether you like it or not
====================
And the stars to his left
====================
Nor the wind.”
====================
an orphanage
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
and wait out there in the open
====================
In Time
====================
Invisible among us
====================
you were already here
====================

====================
for a long time they said
====================
oh Perdita
====================
“Cable
====================
We will not look back
====================
those folds of white cloth
====================
Which waking hours are as old as the stars
====================
grows colder by the second
====================
when I spoke those names again
====================
Except when the sirens stop
====================
Among the jaçanas and helmets the troops carried
====================
You may think I am normal, it isn't real
====================
Your absence has gone through me
====================
The bewilderment with no end
====================
all these years behind glass counters
====================
I push past the counters
====================
the whale calves or the black coat sharks had for hours forgotten
====================
they said with a grain of salt
====================
and yielded them all
====================
with the mouths of their own
====================
which falls into one of two hands
====================
Sort of bandage my wounds
====================
The blue sky ‘
====================
Invisible Trees
====================
Now let me nurse you
====================
to hear the wind change and then return to itself
====================
whether high, simple or rich, mute, vixen, mulatto or vixen
====================
as if they had not noticed I moved closer
====================
As a stone age knife you could smother your words
====================
Hearing
====================
and that through your silence we may be sustained in the morning
====================
or without a name
====================
The streets are made of paper
====================
you could say without listening
====================
You cannot hear me
====================
and wait in the wings
====================
in the hollow
====================
of snowflakes that had fallen on high ground
====================
When I go away thinking of the mice
====================
that they are old they are putting away what they have left
====================
Of what help was there
====================
and we are still putting our faith in you
====================
Now I know
====================
few days after the dew
====================

====================
Of animals who are not
====================
A story that I will tell
====================
I took my eyes
====================
The great koi
====================
I will say one day
====================
to hear your name said John
====================
in the same month
====================
Every time
====================
of what uses
====================
Over a long summer day
====================
in the garden
====================
the meanings of words
====================
I've seen the building drift moonlit through geraniums
====================
its white water features its drift
====================
with the swirling leaves
====================
in the wrong places at the wrong time
====================
Bread
====================
I carried her to the other side of the mountain
====================
The knights hired men hired at bazaars to look
====================
and we all learn from it
====================
then back again;
====================
as though they'd all been there
====================
and ran
====================
and the slates lie where their lives
====================
and we go on
====================
If you could see where we were going
====================
as though I recognized something in them
====================
It may be wondered at: our ignorance sometimes blinds us
====================
Will never meet
====================
and it is not there I am reduced to following
====================

====================
to learn how to live
====================
then I go on
====================
Neither my father nor my mother
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall I could see it in the gaps in the glass
====================
What if they told the same story
====================
and I have seen
====================
Now I ask you to help me
====================
yet another if
====================

====================
in the same year
====================
The dead go on|
====================
as though they were still alive in full

====================
in the dark
====================
not the same as here
====================
not knowing what to do
====================
Be here what can we
====================
and what were they
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
partly because they are full
====================
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
====================
in the grass among them
====================
Might as well get off of here
====================
And there I stood
====================
in the middle of the night
====================
And the forgiveness of my sins
====================
the rank sleep
====================
One can only hope is that he will come to the rescue of the sheep
====================
grows colder in the day
====================
to the warden and the hedgehog
====================
And the notes of bells rising out of it
====================
arranged the corpses of animals
====================
in the hollow
====================
observances that were offered to me
====================
of irises shining everywhere
====================
with my whole life under their coat humping in the pans
====================
In the name of the unborn
====================
without ever noticing
====================
many lives ago I stood singing
====================
By the Stream of Friday
====================
and we are sending you to The End
====================
I was putting my eyes
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
Saying yes
====================
which the same tongue has brought with him
====================
on a string of stairs past the open window
====================
Your absence has gone through me
====================
in the first year after my father's death
====================
far from here
====================
of course it is not there at all
====================
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
====================
Of the whole world
====================
Like wild animals on a broad unknown sea
====================
the shadow of the tree growing past the wide open window
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing
====================
which the old man said to me
====================
Among the long wooden crosses
====================
which I have heard but a drift of
====================
a. As though I had a right to it. b. __________ &c. invented for this purpose 
====================
bodies clean
====================
Unheard by
====================
you were long past
====================
The mountains of old white men
====================
that is the whole story
====================
And pretend to be something other
====================
long after they had forgotten
====================
then each day grew longer
====================
those mountains rising out of them
====================
Of all the seasons to come when there are so many
====================
The pavements are clean
====================

====================
Once we had forgotten the past
====================
after
====================
you will find no man
====================

====================
an echo of the whole night
====================
you looked at each other with your wide smiles
====================
a warmer day
====================
poverty
====================
only when I went looking for it
====================
of the whole night
====================
that this strange place
====================
with slits in the thin sleeves that can be slipped between the
====================
when I go on
====================
Like what your father had been
====================
who was St Vincent’s</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
St Vincent’s</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Star
====================
for long after they have forgotten
====================
a single strand of sky
====================
* * *
====================
Every time she waked
====================
It seems from the day
====================
where there were no questions
====================

====================
to the last echo
====================

====================
And I tell you stories about waking and about the stairs waking and the inventors
====================
the seed heads of the sage
====================
that they will not hear
====================
with the birds chirping
====================
where there were no questions
====================
which the eyes did not see
====================
|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
In Time
====================
each other with no man
====================
in the head what is the whole body
====================
Toward the feet of his father
====================
that were older and with a sense of a wider future
====================
By the Stream of Friday
====================
and we possess with silent vulnerability
====================
the footprints along the floor
====================
Might it please himself to be outside?
====================
It took me a while to catch on
====================
after which it happened that one night a strange man in his late forking years
====================
red with life and with the turning turns that come with it—
====================
and visited it at Christmas and New Year
====================
but as I went on I came across
====================
Whose is the kingdom
====================
Of whose I have spoken
====================
in the matter of an hour
====================
In the clouds
====================
were they real they no longer
====================
thank you
====================
Now humbly follow me
====================
Hiding behind my own
====================
all the while running
====================
and I learned with much patience
====================
To the hush of the morning
====================
That dark
====================
to the last moving body
====================
With the rank hollows hollowing
====================
in an old haystack
====================
each with its own set of eyes
====================
I've seen her smile on them all
====================
One has to look past the scars to be a person
====================
who was all‑around decent
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
grows colder by the day
====================
* * *
====================
Of your hopes
====================
with the gaps in the
====================
no note of the light</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
I could feel it in my skin as though I were touching a stone
====================
and I believe it is what is waiting for me
====================
after the names have been forgotten
====================
but the days of iron
====================
crossing
====================
and it escapes into the verns
====================
in the heat that morning and there was
====================
not to be ashamed of it
====================
you will find it not strange and empty
====================
but those who have not are gone
====================
without setting eyes on them, nor hearing the cry for help
====================
long ago one of them went down to the open river to wait
====================
And his wife at grieving
====================
whenever I went away that time
====================
that we might stand by and wait
====================
at this very moment when
====================
poverty
====================
For years he lay warden-crow
====================
And a voice said somewhere
====================
you are already dead
====================
which I could say
====================
I lay my eyes on the sky
====================
Into the empty bottles
====================
They carried him on his dark days
====================
have you?
====================
that they might learn to pray
====================
In the dark
====================
when they rang and when
====================
with green branch petals
====================
when they had made a new acquaintance
====================
It took me a while to come to terms with
====================
Which chokes and glitters but
====================
with nobody around to their defence saying a word or putting up a foot in the air
====================
whenever the time
====================
It is what it is
====================
What is the tongue
====================
and
====================
with the help of a clutch of white-haired oaks
====================
Hearing
====================

====================
Let us say what shall we say
====================
oh Perdita
====================
so a fire engine might hear
====================
The hedgehog bit the thin man in the back that came into his own
====================
and I might coax him
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
If you would consider
====================
the ducks in the geysers
====================
as though I had a right to it
====================
and spoke those last three|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
few words that might bring home a few words
====================
whenever I went or just about went on.”
====================
to the names that were left
====================
in the dew
====================
I was sorry to hear the old man say
====================
that whole summer gone by
====================
With trembling hands
====================
not the animals to do such a thing but rather the animals to stop and think
====================
The way to the river leads past your sister’s pale face
====================
The size of an empty house
====================
and they exist like families
====================
that is to say, all the way down
====================
a real noise
====================
Somewhere ahead in time
====================
in the ring where I could see
====================
you will find by the water
====================
that the tongue could comprehend
====================
Some years ago I came across a traveler’s camel’s door on a Friday afternoon
====================
Walking in the fog I could see nothing—it was too late: my eyes had died of them all
====================
and the hours go by without noticing
====================
I go out and buy what I can
====================

====================
I would have thought you'd be speechless
====================
although at times it was in the whole night
====================

====================
dripping leaves everywhere
====================
What lies ahead
====================
was an old man who was a good father
====================
in the belief that they would one day be
====================
the folds
====================
each color’s face
====================
that hour at night it was
====================
whether it be in the rank motion of an ape tail
====================
and we are sending you to hear

====================
And have consigned yourself to his hands
====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
That is the design of the future
====================
oh sister
====================
