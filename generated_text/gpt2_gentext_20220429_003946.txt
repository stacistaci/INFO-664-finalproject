for a living
====================
But Asgore said
====================
of course the old man said
====================
Every time they assembled and he spoke to them
====================

====================
I am not a man
====================
I had imagined them all when I was young
====================
Every time
====================
Where I was born
====================

====================
And my voice to your God
====================

====================
I took the stairs
====================
observances
====================
It isn't as simple as that.
====================
and we shall meet again
====================
in those old days they would all say the same word
====================
You arrive at the rank hollow
====================
and we spoke our own tongue
====================
or.

====================
Have you ever seen one?
====================
have told me
====================
that the tongue might say
====================
The old knights who would not go away
====================
in the bandage over his wound
====================
Come and be company
====================
for countless lives
====================
in the little beam
====================
but neither my father nor my mother had.
====================
which I know I have put
====================
with my whole body weeps as we explain
====================
Once upon a time I heard the shepherd say
====================
and coaxed out of the wells
====================
not the whole story but a brief description of what is going on
====================
but the soul
====================
with the hollow branches still standing
====================
There should be a prescribed floor
====================
The black sea
====================
for ever after
====================
Hearing
====================
What shall I say?’s
====================
which is why I have left the other day
====================
Now I go away looking
====================
the tunnels to the mouths of the gorges
====================
without whom no attention could be gained
====================
or if I please
====================
an echo singing birds
====================
And Asking God
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
As though they had no idea
====================
many years of age
====================
Are you sure
====================
I have stretched my knowledge
====================
And through the bars and the tomes
====================
Sort of as the wind in the field
====================
we exist from within
====================
in a hedge
====================
whom I call father
====================
and studied like children
====================
and I write to say
====================
Were born that way
====================
as though they owned it
====================
The way to the river leads north through the woods past the flickering of clocks
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
We spoke our own tongue
====================
Your inner contradictions
====================
oh Perdita
====================
because the old man spoke the old man
====================
and those who have passed over
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
with no acquaintance
====================
and certainly no sound from his ears
====================
appears to be passing them by they say
====================
And each day with time
====================
Of gods and men and the nights have changed into the days of the earth
====================
The beat of my heart
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
The birds were singing
====================
From where I stood I could see them all
====================
which I know well enough to say
====================
when I went away looking
====================
whether daily or thrice a day
====================
it is hard to think of anything less reprehensible
====================
still they push him on through the night
====================
And for what?
====================
to meet in the open field
====================
You will be called to a new age
====================
but my design was never to meet
====================
and its bells rising out of it bright as the moon
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
The clutch full of shoes lying
====================

====================
Will anyone listen?
====================
Neither my father nor my mother
====================
bodies clean and smooth white heads white heads white heads
====================
wherewith the clouds rising and the thundering
====================
that they are part of a wider fabric of things
====================
which tells of the world
====================
with names that begin with a dash
====================
You are the fabric of the earth
====================
They said
====================
not knowing the name
====================
with eyes wide open and mouths full of money
====================
and I find myself answering: There are too many of us
====================
whiskering on into the short neck
====================
* * *
====================
Hearing
====================
which I have learned
====================
out of charity to my sister
====================
with their corpses
====================
Each carved and twisted name
====================
I knelt before her in the doorway
====================
Hearing not of anyone but themselves I turned to you
====================
Now turning to the future
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
with each other
====================
with no acquaintance
====================
Unheard by us
====================
I would say so
====================
I know
====================
whether he like it or not
====================
Come up behind me and-

====================
Who is there to judge? Who is there to be blamed
====================
from your absence I might say so.
====================
and the lightning has shown me
====================
The animals kept within kept without

====================
If your name is not a name
====================
in the daylight
====================
exploded into the sluiced vaults
====================
even from the tips of their noses
====================
not knowing where I was or what to do
====================
which is how I came to it
====================
I might have guessed from the order in which
====================
were simply there words to carry them out
====================
those bookeys that are the order of my day
====================
I lay my head
====================
an iron spike rising from its own place
====================

====================
of water
====================
many lives ago there was a man who led his family
====================
There with you
====================
the game of thrones
====================
where we were then
====================
Do not look up. There is nothing here
====================
and the light return
====================

====================
and held it high
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
The roadmen are catching the flies and the birds are singing
====================
I said thank you
====================
only to be broken down into smaller parts
====================
Needing no other
====================
which they would coax
====================
with the sleeves torn away and the folds
====================
in time they came to a turn and a corner on the screen A big fat white man with a big nose and a big jaw looking out over the screen and a big lump on the screen and a big pop on the screen and a big pop on the screen and the big pop on the screen and all the while the big man kept looking at the screen looking at the big man saying something along the lines of

====================
So it will be when I beget old
====================
and the turning glitters of late
====================
anxious to know what is up with me
====================
staring down at each of our faces
====================
which I know will not escape me
====================
You will be old as the stars
====================
That my ape friends
====================
pale today; but he will find himself tomorrow
====================
at midnight on a Sunday
====================
You must have seen me when I was young
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
to the Burnt Child
====================
And there I was listening
====================
with our eyes we are saying thank you
====================
And gladden to meet you
====================
few voices saying what shall we say.
====================
that they could get over
====================
a new order of things
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
as though I owned it
====================
when I
====================
whatever my tears dry
====================
bodies white with the radiance of the moon
====================
Whose willing-be
====================
which are set down as stories
====================
somewhere in the daylight
====================
with a younger face I hear him saying
====================
endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
‘I knew I would come up short
====================
in the flickering twilight
====================
on the back of the house where my father and my mother were born
====================
And I believe he was
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================

====================
in the garden a blind man was standing listening
====================
in the rank hollow
====================

====================
and we will say thank you
====================
to wait
====================
with no acquaintance’s door howling in the hollow
====================
in a marriage what is there left
====================
Be here what can I
====================
When I go away
====================
If I might coax you with a cord
====================
which will arrive when I go
====================
to be sustained by its dark breath
====================
to go away and be
====================
When I go on
====================
In a dream I go looking for what I have to do
====================
Excepting the one thing
====================
yet as though I recognized something in them
====================
with a handful of water in my hair
====================
pumping oxygen to the old man
====================
Come and be company
====================
but they have learned to fear ours
====================
which are a normal part of the day
====================
in another day
====================
and those in the front ranged
====================
are there trees who do not fear
====================
And his lying on the tables
====================
and the night was falling
====================
we all knew it to be real before we spoke
====================
Now
====================
partly for the ways and partly to meet in the numbers
====================
You will find it on the table
====================
you would not have guessed from the order in which
====================

====================
whether the hollow
====================
having turned into a beautiful valley
====================
and we were learning
====================
Like an iron curtain that droned over and caught the light
====================
The wind is blowing the building-tops
====================
it will never be the same; it will be the marks of drift
====================
without a shadow
====================
‘Come and be company
====================
is a tongue has
====================
wandering on
====================
Men think they are better than grass
====================
and the gaps in the
====================
Of the whole earth
====================
forgotten names
====================
and I had imagined them all when I was young
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Once a time a fish went down and was wont to wait
====================
with the sky
====================
Of whose very words I say
====================
when I go on
====================
we will all die of weaning
====================
The red flags went away and went away
====================
and bring the dead to their places
====================
but they will come to nothing
====================
Or may God be pleased with you
====================
without understanding
====================
To the handful of sheep we have brought
====================
and with them the mornings silence
====================
a


====================
across the courtyard and I could hear the scratch and flare
====================
and if I may ask what is the matter
====================
as though they had never happened
====================
nothing at all
====================
Asking them what they are doing
====================
for ever after
====================
long after I had imagined
====================
is there such a thing as the death knell
====================
as though it were something very real to me
====================
in the glimmering ponds
====================
with no understanding
====================

====================
The broad cabanas the leaves of the cherry trees high on the horizon
====================
And
====================
in the wrong places at the wrong time
====================
to learn from others
====================
Of specimens of the old
====================
one of them was a boy in the same dress who turned out to be a fox
====================

====================
whatever it is that we do not know
====================
the fires long extinguished
====================
in those hospitals my eyes
====================
to breathe on their own
====================
you could hear the scratch and flare
====================
with the moon in the sky
====================
many lives ago I stood still
====================
Surprised at the numbers
====================
the wells they had been built on they had fallen in and had fallen out
====================
the hopes of the old
====================
a name you might have forgotten
====================
Now those two hands
====================
only when the numbers stop shaking
====================
to meet you face to face
====================
The binding has fallen in; it is time
====================
that came with me
====================
* * *
====================
long after the Stream of Friday
====================
Walking on the fields on rainy mornings
====================
where we have come with the age
====================
we never saw you
====================
In the shoes of my father
====================
the eyes started from your head
====================

====================
I've seen her on a number of occasions
====================
as though it had never happened
====================
which tells of a river
====================
although we cannot comprehend
====================
Over their lives the incidents have gone through them
====================
you warden put his finger to the cool stone
====================
it needs speaking
====================

====================
whenever we had the most tender needs
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
and from here to the wall the wind sighs
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
The chokes and the rubbish are the same everywhere
====================
in the heat that day
====================
If it were possible
====================
with no door or window
====================

====================
The river one
====================
At times now from under the blankets
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
to the name of</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Far Company
====================
of what was once||endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a farm with its fields of wheat and passed the summer
====================
although the color changed as the hour went on
====================
I have studied your retinas
====================
somewhere ahead
====================
they never saw
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
whenever they saw it happen
====================
the numbers walk on our faces
====================
not knowing what to do
====================
which can only end when all the way out is past
====================
Thanks
====================
the late
====================
with tears in the turns and in the chokes
====================
I hear the wind
====================
of the waterfalls
====================
Walls That Do Not Fit
====================
said
====================
No what are the feet
====================
the beam Coming from your own size
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
That fell into his own hands
====================
and the clouds the plains
====================
Walls they are made of they are made of
====================
with the wind she walks on water
====================
when the wings open and the whale calves come to rest on
====================
in the hope that they might one day be
====================
It is impossible to know
====================
they said to him

====================
the moon finds them
====================
several of them wider than me
====================

====================
as though they had all learned from it
====================
there at hand I held
====================
While the ghosts ride on the boors
====================
and she kept saying Come on over
====================
of broad daylight across the valley
====================
oh by the Stream of Friday
====================
far from here
====================
the dawn of history
====================
and tell him
====================
Among them is a fox lying motionless
====================
Now let me
====================
betrayals so long repeated
====================
and will do
====================
that is to say understood.”
====================
Except the hired hands
====================
We should all be old before the world was told
====================

====================
Your feet have been
====================
You lie on your backs
====================
in the hollow
====================
a future without you
====================
I've heard tales of ravens and of goats
====================
The way to the river leads past the late
====================
Asking what shall I say
====================
so they might come to understand
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall
====================
I said thank you
====================
Among the flames there is life
====================
Of infinite kindness I grant you
====================
observances as though he had a right to it
====================
of waterfalls
====================
as though I'd pointed out something about them
====================
From what I could see it looked like this tree
====================
Are there trees who have never seen them
====================
those Who Live
====================
No note of her tears;
====================
and the last he spoke
====================
as though they'd been given a name
====================
Though I have not seen
====================
To the house of the mapmaker
====================
appearing on the dark
====================
as though they'd all learned
====================
Your hands as trees borne away on a flood
====================
When I go on
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
asleep
====================
a blind man painted over a window
====================
in a field full of them
====================
felt it was worth it
====================
in the hollow
====================
and I could hear the scratch and flare
====================
it glitters
====================
in a parked cab by the open farmhouse
====================
Now we are putting our faith in you
====================
Or from a city I knew
====================
Let me call a friend
====================
And say Thank you
====================
For the names that are old
====================
and we are saying thank you
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
that game was started when I was young
====================
not to touch them at all
====================
where I had not been
====================
lying on their backs
====================
in the broad daylight they assembled to a door
====================
and find it at the door
====================
The hollow plumage boosts the moon
====================
at times as simple and with little sorrow
====================
not for long.  Anyway
====================
What are the feet
====================
before waking and they kept saying Come on over
====================
The weather will be tawny and the leaves gray.”
====================
as though I were speaking again
====================
To the glories of suburbia
====================
many lives ago he stretched out his hands
====================
I will not lose sight of thee
====================
we turn away from the trees
====================
When I went away looking
====================
That is what I am
====================
who are we
====================
a name that tells of its day
====================
there is the silence
====================
Feeling it needs saying a little late
====================
have you heard
====================
the whale calves with their hangmen
====================
Loss to the Animals
====================
and has kept his hired man
====================
said:

====================
wandering on
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
thank you
====================
whenever we had the most. But what if I had only known? Instead I would have guessed.
====================
Poverty
====================
Whose will be done
====================
to hear those who would listen.”
====================
with our mouths full of food
====================
of course I know the design
====================
and the voices of the men
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
there for the evening
====================
the dark wires under the helmets
====================
Just because it fits
====================
and which the eye sees through the coveralls
====================

====================
although a small one
====================
The glimmering villages
====================
I consider that I was always good to was last
====================
I bring you this time
====================
In another city
====================
In front of me they were building The silence was too brief
====================
Might as well be old as the day
====================
all the way down
====================
that they would appear before all.
====================
Jailed in himself
====================
Once upon a time there were all the words out of a man
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
Thinking over hissing boars it had been
====================
and warden
====================
and did not believe until I saw it in the eyes of the child
====================
particular wind
====================
when we go on
====================
to be sustained on by its dark breath
====================
I was born to be a shepherd
====================
the kissing
====================
somewhere ahead in time
====================
Hiding
====================
I return to my father
====================
for I see how they have changed
====================
with our mouths full of food
====================
as though it were something else
====================
the Night of the Shirts standing
====================
or gave me a name
====================
of waterfalls
====================
With little following behind
====================
To the anonymous river
====================
“Far Company
====================
whether taken for granted or forgotten
====================
after whom I spoke
====================
as though I were speaking now
====================
In another he appeared to her
====================
And said I, I see
====================
The dark wires of the lightning have been dealt the dice
====================
nothing at this time but the sound of it
====================
and write your name after what I have been
====================
bodies white and roof slanting in behind
====================
and handed over to me
====================
and spoke the names
====================
The bewilderment with which I have been led
====================
oh Perdita
====================
of iron
====================
The thin beam that caught the light
====================
those whose days were numbered
====================
It is I I am calling
====================
Be here what can we
====================
What was it I asked

====================
the iron bells chime in from time to time
====================
out of the blue
====================
and this time we were speaking of singing
====================

====================
to hear
====================
above them all and the invisible
====================
which are to say nothing of the days of his father
====================
what numbers can you
====================
Of salt water
====================
to the pointless song of the dead
====================
as though they had known me all along
====================
that it learn thereby
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
high into the house
====================
With the notes lingering
====================
what is the tongue
====================
Might it please himself to be near
====================
which I knew to consist mainly of bewilderment
====================
And this is how we live
====================
Far From Here
====================
Overhead there are mountains of smoke
====================
Then find another
====================
somewhere between our eyes
====================
All the way north on the train the sun was setting where I had left off
====================
This vision I have of my
====================
And forgive nothing
====================
with a risk to the future
====================
Now that I know
====================
Might not say a word>

====================
Leaving behind it the future
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
pale in the daylight while they
====================
Was there anything unusual or unusual about her hair?
====================
and as it were a window into another person's soul
====================
oh Perdita
====================
Have you my dog
====================
Poke round a hollow bone
====================
for while we waited
====================

====================
and the names of the animals he had seen
====================
to the last word
====================
I will not look away.
====================

====================
whether in form or in time
====================
of names
====================
in the forests I see them all the same day
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
You see I have said that before
====================
to the bowing of the sheep
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
That though it were the turning of autumn that had given
====================
in the same time zone
====================
While I studied
====================
So I humbly bow to you
====================
it escapes its own
====================
I have told the same story
====================
in the last full moon of the year
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
in the morning of the Great Sleep
====================
or at least I thought so until I heard someone singing
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
whether for the good of the few
====================
of the whole night
====================
then the same voice goes away from me
====================
as though I owned it
====================
of twilight the pale villages
====================
I go out and buy the old man food
====================
long after all who make music
====================
and we have studied them all with the same longing
====================
the remnants
====================
many lives ago
====================
a. Under them the sky is white with the moon
====================
of fire and brimstone
====================
Dawn at the bend in the road
====================
which he remembered nothing of
====================
and among them were the raggedy goats
====================
which are set down afterward
====================
unheard by
====================
wandering on
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
oh Consoling you with tender arms
====================
and foreordaining
====================
yet beautiful in the change of seasons
====================
a flame lit by a single strand of hair
====================
And the Night will come to and fro
====================
what is the tongue
====================
the fire engines turning green
====================
I lay my hand upon it
====================
I try and remember
====================
* * *
====================
it lies beyond our comprehension
====================
What is the tongue
====================
Each opening its own way
====================
Hearing
====================
piling up into a open field
====================
If your father said
====================
Which I do not understand
====================
with numbers going on in my head
====================

====================
To the last of the digits
====================
to the unconquerable mountain
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
the red flags of time
====================
Holy charity to those who are escaping
====================
They've torn the fabric of time askew
====================
What a strange life it is
====================
They said thank you, never once would I have imagined someone as simple and patient with them as you
====================
which it had the design of replacing
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
those who play the game
====================
And all the ways of the future
====================
whether in the form of parchment or hieroglyphs
====================
then I push my tongue along it
====================
they put him in their company
====================
Which came later with me
====================
which if we allowed it we would all die
====================
what are the hands
====================
and though we might be few we are what we are accused of
====================
Just to remind you all
====================
and I've seen her at school and at home and in the trees
====================
wherewith no place
====================
yet our faces
====================
as though I were there
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
I uncover my face and see through the glass
====================
with the same set of eyes
====================
when they turned green in the fields and forests and the red-hot oil on the fires
====================
whether it is the good old days when we were young or the times when we are
====================
What if we could
====================
Do they know me?
====================
a time when writing was a simple thing to do
====================
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
====================
for ever
====================
those who were born before our eyes
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
To the bewilderment of time
====================
we are sending you to The End
====================
the great waves of the sea
====================
And the Night will Come
====================
Be here what can we
====================
In Time
====================
Hiding as though it had never happened
====================
then we stitched them together into a new one color
====================
There he is I do not see
====================
said they were assembled at last to hear the voice of the man
====================
I wear the whole day's wear
====================
Oh green branch smudged with iron and lime and salt and rubbly iron •
====================
where we are a place of iron
====================
who have died before me
====================
which we might have learned by now
====================
And one small one
====================
Every time they turned away they saw
====================
And all the way north through the morning
====================
whisker on the paper without understanding
====================
And sing of mute feet
====================
Will the river lean in its banks
====================
What kind of police will go door-to-door tracking down the fugitives
====================
Will any come back will one
====================
with no note of their own
====================
Here comes the little creature
====================
searching
====================
over water that ran along it
====================
in the shoes of the killed
====================
whether it be at home, at the turn where I was born
====================
hearing
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall that led out past each of us
====================
Some chalks ago
====================
the white whale
====================
when I went away looking
====================
which leaves the door wide open
====================
without changing
====================
To the rank mountains white as the stars
====================
when I go on
====================
what if they could be made invisible
====================
When I was young and with no older sister’s
====================
and remembered him
====================
that where I had gone
====================
the nights I kept looking up
====================
forgetting what they had just been through
====================
Come and be company
====================
whenever I could
====================
to be made of paper
====================
and offer up a handful
====================
the long sleep
====================
Now my dearest dearest dearest dearest dearest
====================
Oh juggler
====================
That it learn thereby</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy charity.
====================
Thanks
====================
then he announced it and it went on
====================
And the days hang medals between us
====================
there is nothing beyond
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
Will you excuse me
====================
with
====================
and there on a crosshanging sky
====================
as though they'd all been there
====================
Breathe
====================
without comment
====================
It is not his name who is calling
====================
a sight to behold
====================
no one has asked me this before
====================
to the names of
====================
in a dream
====================
whatever it took to maintain its color.
====================
that they are accomplishing what they are not accomplishing
====================
many years ago
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
that came with me and parked in the back
====================
in the fall of the last of the last
====================
only after we had imagined
====================
and stood listening
====================
Each waking moment he remembers
====================
which have climbed into the hollows
====================
to the rank and unshorn garments
====================
As for the goats
====================
In all the years we never knew
====================
gaining the attention of the children
====================
In the wide lane the cows come running
====================
of waterfalls
====================
to the door that it answered I open it and there are the tables
====================
Whose ways were his own;
====================
with varying plums
====================
Like the day the late have given me
====================
in the highlands of the

====================
after I taught
====================
And the days hang medals between us
====================
they will turn to you
====================
with its twisted stalks and its fallow
====================
The moon
====================
whether it is the old order of things or the wider world
====================
Into the wrong night
====================
what we were told to do about it
====================
But Cable said
====================
many lives ago they stood in the sunlight and peered out
====================
with no excuse
====================
and the hired hands
====================
Oh bewilderment
====================
The soundtracks to the operas
====================
The cloud tops gale in the small; the hollow
====================
Now we must go home
====================
about to say something that escapes our attention and is repeated a long time after the others have said the same thing
====================
and that he who is old never appeared
====================
and carried on as though it were a normal life
====================
or

====================
thank you
====================
The warden said before we left
====================
but they lie.
====================
I am your name
====================
Some say sleep is impossible
====================

====================
Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease
====================
with the sun already in the leaves
====================
are shining like stars through
====================
invisible if they lasted
====================
that morning
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
It is what it is
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Oh bewilderment
====================
When I go on
====================
several others
====================
* * *
====================
with the gaps in the
====================
and without listening
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
that they might have remembered
====================
and that the stars were above the clouds
====================
you would expect from someone who lives|

====================
with their mouths full of food
====================
Your absence has been felt through the whole night
====================
then the warden said
====================
While there were no longer the wild animals
====================
beside
====================
must have been there somewhere
====================
that time that and for the dead
====================
grows colder by the day
====================
* * *
====================
”Cable?”
====================
And would do such a thing only
====================
and there simply is
====================
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have an incinerator
====================
and I try to think of a good time
====================
Dearly into the next morning
====================
which they knew but a dark word for
====================
those whose names were forgotten
====================
The days of iron
====================
As though it had a right to more
====================
Poverty
====================
Jailed in himself
====================
Catch them all and carry on walking
====================
that the tongue could understand
====================
a tender wound
====================
and it is not there I forget
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
It came with me
====================
Now for the bells.”
====================
and it is not there I am not
====================
 * *
====================
far from here
====================
piling up into the open sky
====================
A rose petals
====================
and we will do whatever it takes to stop you.

====================
and the thread stayed where it was
====================
invisible whether by the feathers or the tears
====================
which is to say
====================
Do you remember the cards that were dealt
====================
Do better still.”
====================
Once I heard the shepherd do the same
====================
these tears speaking of you
====================
you can hear me
====================
as though it were my own body
====================
Then I will no longer
====================
you will find it at all hours
====================
to be dealt among themselves
====================
a name the river Sire
====================
left foot on a rock in the water
====================
said to my father
====================
its notes shuffled after them
====================
in a glass house
====================
which are the uses I have
====================
So I turned to the left
====================
To the Blank Spaces
====================

====================
in numbers
====================
everywhere in the house
====================
And grant forgiveness
====================
That each of you have been
====================
Then the door will come in
====================
with them we go on
====================
crossing villages
====================
to hear the wind carry them
====================
The nurses come running after them
====================
what a game
====================
something as though it had happened without it
====================
those who go before them.
====================
What are the feet
====================
The Stream of Friday
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
That they hear
====================
He said
====================
before I had imagined you
====================
Lily?
====================
not looking where I was coming
====================
You would think you were free from the body parts of extinct animals
====================
What is the tongue
====================
Every time they assembled and he spoke to them
====================
with our faces we meet with
====================
You cannot hear me
====================
That was the whole story;
====================
of the whole world
====================
without speaking a word
====================
Of those who go on dying poorly
====================
you who arrive one after the other
====================
in the starlight as though it were still alive in you
====================
of water
====================
as though I'd said it countless times before
====================
where we have come with our age
====================
and lay between them
====================
in the same night
====================
and risk falling under it
====================
And who are the compatriots
====================
A warm cup full of water
====================
in the boat when we came back from a game of fifteen
====================
Now look over there
====================
and the moon finds itself alone
====================
You see you have your own way
====================
where my body was sight
====================
easing past clouds of smoke into the extinguished
====================
Loss of Light
====================
of unfinished business
====================
or just past the turnstiles that stood on either side
====================
when I look back on the world
====================
If she were alive I would have thought she was happy
====================
the pavements are broken into into into smaller pieces
====================
When I think back to those late nights
====================
the radiance declined through
====================
forgetting the names of the animals
====================
and who would buy him a life of paper thin
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
with little comment
====================
few who were present would have noticed
====================
and the voices of the men
====================
in the same month
====================
I asked
====================
no one hears
====================
the echoing birds
====================
Might I go back to sleep again?
====================
no thought has been given to the populous
====================
what to do
====================
What will that I ask you
====================
Came the small boat-men
====================
that they were born with
====================
which I know how to find
====================
and those
====================
long after the names ring with the echo
====================
to hear step after step explain the stars
====================
as though I had said that many times before
====================
with the words going out like cells of a brain
====================
in a field away
====================
yet with a glint
====================
Your names that were
====================
with slits in the folds that keep the sharp objects like wires under the skin
====================
and among them those beautiful
====================
one is how the tongue sees it
====================
and I found myself looking back on the lives
====================
The numbers wait in the halls and the clouds
====================
forgotten by many
====================
Of what use are they to me
====================
They said thank you but not to me
====================
and told him
====================

====================
He told me once of a time when he was young and there were a great many who gave him company
====================
as though they'd all heard me
====================
To
====================
not understanding what they are doing
====================
and we all humbly bow to you
====================
which I may have invented
====================
whether we like it or not it can hardly be said
====================
a good man and maid
====================
for the cross they offered
====================
the young men and the women
====================
about me they said
====================
Of what use is the world
====================
And the others to follow them
====================
to see who it was
====================
and the whale calves the great white
====================
which after hearing
====================
The dew was drying on them and there were few
====================
Somewhere ahead of me
====================
which are made up of them all
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
after all the sacrifices
====================
so I asked.

====================
a name that tells of its age
====================
when they are gone
====================
the whole night long
====================
when the cards rang
====================
and the wind calls home the branches
====================
Come and beaming
====================
Your absence has gone through me
====================
all along that dark neck
====================
Hearing
====================
Unheard by
====================
blown-up neo-classic facades
====================
across the lane from the hotel where I stayed
====================
I see they are made
====================
If anyone has said a word
====================
which were made of stone and had fallen
====================
whatever was left after the meal
====================
in a parked cab by the sealed wall I could see it in the distance
====================
full of the waiting of their feet
====================
we went on saying thank you
====================
whether green or red
====================
They are the stalks that are undergrowth
====================
I was born here
====================
oh Stream where the boughs are
====================
that they had heard but a shadow
====================
It is how I have come to it
====================
But I have seen you little green men
====================
Toward the feet of my father
====================
in the Twenties
====================
and have broken it down into smaller blocks
====================
Some passers-by had seen them when they went by the glass.

====================
whether it's the lithe frame of a house-cat or the clean coat worn by the gorillas
====================
steep as branches
====================
In a parked cab by the sealed wall I can see the faces
====================
Which color were they from the beginning
====================
And forgive nothing
====================
where the shadows go
====================
And always with the singing birds
====================
They said thank you so much
====================
as one stream of thought
====================
in the forests
====================
Of my youth as a child
====================
I might as well go away and have a good time
====================
when we are done
====================
whether giddy with themselves
====================
Of suffering
====================
That are to say: anonymous. But nobody has noticed
====================
a curve in the glass that led out of it
====================
then go on
====================
When I went away looking
====================

====================
And offered up as sacrifices
====================
Among the singing bees
====================
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have the heaters
====================
With my whole life ahead of me
====================
for fear they should be forgotten
====================
What do you see
====================

====================
kept hidden in the shadows
====================
a silent song of his
====================
I bow my head and pray
====================

====================
with the last words
====================
The pavements are broken glass
====================
