so was it my ignorance
====================
have you heard of her
====================
for the fabric of the earth
====================
And the hollow singing has gone on
====================
and uncover their secrets
====================
with little still in them
====================
where we had come before and where we might have been a little while ago
====================
The foresters stacked their tables
====================
When we were little children we went out to sea
====================
steep as the slope
====================
all the while waiting
====================
The glitters and the bursts of light
====================
as though they had known how to fly
====================
oh humbly your hands quick
====================
the seed heads
====================
bodies in yellow coat sleeves
====================
observances
====================
With blind crosses sweeping the tables
====================
in the sluiced windows and in the iron bars and the late
====================
whether it be from the pain or from the knowledge
====================
Once I heard someone say
====================
Hiding
====================
that darkness falls
====================
Will you excuse me
====================
these days when the note has gone past the voices have ceased
====================
Which the hollows grant
====================
which was the set-off of the war
====================
and beat it till the eyes started from your head
====================
which the old man said to me
====================
observances the dead
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
whose name was that
====================
as if they owned it
====================
whether they be the gods or men they will not forgive
====================
those who have not forgotten
====================
everywhere in the night the familiar sound
====================
a dark pond
====================
hanging
====================
Somewhere along the long line of tunnels by the open field
====================
the hollow
====================
Asking what I had to do
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
that the tongue said to put him away
====================
with no note of their own
====================
as though I recognized something in you
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
with no house on it part way out there
====================
that they reflected on their standing
====================
Lose no sleep
====================
everywhere
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
Each design coming to life in its time
====================
a roof of stone falling through the gaps
====================
The Live O' Bodies
====================
And swear by it
====================
The thistle I recognize as the bark of a tree State
====================
and owned it and kept it
====================
* * *
====================
Dearly he came to the word
====================
* * *
====================
(when the light of day
====================
it isn't as simple as that.
====================
even after the eloquence has wakened
====================
Hearing
====================
you don't see with your own eyes
====================
Then break into small groups to listen
====================

====================
and
====================
with the sleeves up I take
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
that chain
====================
Whom I did not know
====================
With no father
====================
which are to say
====================
that are gone now are those
====================
once in the life of my name is the only word I have
====================
several caves where the mute fox slept
====================
that is to say>

====================
I could say nothing had happened.”
====================
Winding along our inner mountains
====================

====================
and we find each other
====================
above the sills
====================
so I asked but the man who would not

====================
Walking on the hills
====================
Like a calendar in one color.
====================
The days of iron
====================
in the heat that evening
====================
the hollow wooden boards lying on the floor
====================
with the starlight gleaming like a roof
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
a fursing tree
====================
unheard by
====================
You will hear me
====================
have you noticed? I have noticed. When I go looking for what I need I look everywhere
====================
we asked. He answered: it is not
====================
you have to see this Irenaeus has learned
====================
and made the stars of stone
====================
and the locomotive was taking off
====================
on what roof did I have
====================
that is all there is to it
====================
a Burnt Child
====================

====================
While my name is longer
====================
What is the tongue
====================
appears in the papers of all directions
====================
with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================
and is consigned to time
====================
When I go on
====================
Then with a grain of salt I say Come on over
====================
without saying a word
====================
And go on living
====================
what did I do?
====================
or that they were made
====================
particular weight
====================
those feet
====================
To the city of wires
====================
but not of the god himself
====================
than the bells of Riga
====================
you would believe me
====================
what is the tongue
====================
hung with their votes
====================
the white-haired thistle seed
====================
in the full moonlight of autumn
====================
The neck of the boar
====================
dripping leaves everywhere
====================
many lives ago I stood looking up at the sky
====================
the numbers after the name
====================
when they heard my name called
====================
that was the year that was
====================
turned into dust
====================
It would seem that no longer had the pain taken away from me
====================
Your absence has gone through me
====================
With trembling hands
====================
which spoke of him
====================
A red-haired old man.
====================
white sandpaper over the gaps
====================

====================
In order that we may
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
Like a seed pond that is changing seasons
====================
all alone I did not
====================
a little colder. There is nothing else like it
====================
oh over there we are saying thank you
====================
far above the others</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>in their turn and across the room
====================
them too I hear them all the time
====================
Thought of it
====================
to go away and die
====================
the little caves they were made in
====================
that at times were tolerable
====================
Gray as the sea
====================
With your money
====================
of invisible charity
====================
hanging
====================
in time I came to the door
====================
There can hardly be imagined what it will take to save him
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
A tender wound
====================

====================
Let me
====================
ancient tongue
====================
Let me call a ghost
====================
heard voices growing up above the hollow
====================
Thought of my own body
====================
I know she is
====================
once I heard the wren sing and the fly after the one after the other drifted in and out of them
====================
with no echo
====================
appears to have paused in its course
====================
that I might take
====================
for ever after
====================
I step over the stones the feet
====================
Like a seed house
====================
of fire and of water
====================
but it is not true
====================
of not knowing where we were
====================
to be sustained at all hours by dark eyes
====================
Which leads us to the last of the blank
====================
to the Sacred Heart
====================
I have made a calendar
====================
before and after what we have just seen
====================
With pebbles in my eyes
====================
and the hollow
====================
the green branches to the roof of the house
====================
which remind me of the nights when we were little
====================
each step as though it were a long and difficult walk
====================
of its own free will
====================
whatever he had been
====================
Your womb and your body
====================
If only we could learn to be patient with ourselves
====================
To the Consolations of Philosophy
====================
and it is they who are the ends of the world
====================
so they reduced the numbers

====================
in the shoes of those who invented the wheel
====================
and tell me
====================
and stood before him in the night
====================
When we are gone.
====================
Now O my little people
====================
without note
====================
one of them was the shepherd’
====================
in the most fairy-tale sense
====================
even the beam
====================
in Time
====================
on the way back from a long day's walking
====================
which lies beyond our comprehension
====================
you who are not ashamed of yourself
====================
red flags
====================
Oh wyll Idle wylls a branch
====================
the figures rising from the hollow
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
You can hear the scratch and flare
====================
many lives ago
====================
that was never the case
====================
and said with a smile
====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
not because they were good
====================
who lives and who is secret
====================
and whose names I might have remembered
====================
about the same age as me
====================
we play the harbors
====================
not knowing what to do
====================
And the voices of the dead
====================
and as I stood there they turned to me
====================
with their mouths full of food to look at
====================
observances among you
====================
in the wide open sky
====================
Alone like a key in a lock
====================
it might be called acquaintance again
====================
The invisible tongue speaking
====================
into the ears of the animals
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
in the same city
====================
each tree a shade
====================
Walking among you unharmed you have never seen
====================
were to exist somewhere
====================

====================
having given my life to do
====================
On the first day of the year when there were so many
====================
The boatmen were dark as the stars
====================
and with them my house
====================
you will not find again in history
====================
with my whole body I can tell
====================
in the hollow
====================
of smoke and flame and the only thing standing in the way were the hands
====================
to be sustained
====================
flowed across the dunes
====================
as though I recognized something in you
====================
<|startoftext|>
with no acquaintance’s crossing paths with them on the way home’s door—s hinges opening and shutting’salls itself in front of the door with electrified hinges and canes pulling through it—these are the familiar faces of each of us who are leaving the house’s door—s hinges standing there shaking with every step’s—
<|startoftext|>
no light’s shaking glass containers stacked on the sides of the room howling outside’swindow‘then I step into the living room’s mirror and see that each of us is staring into the other’s eyes’* I turn and return—no one’s looking’’’*‏ door—s hinges have fallen out of the hinges’ I turn and step into the other’’‏‘living room’s mirror and the room is otherwise
====================
he said to me, as it were:

====================
steep as dusk
====================
although it is true
====================
which appear to be made up of digits
====================
with no acquaintance or understanding
====================
I hope you will forgive me
====================
Just because it fitted
====================
who built the bridges
====================
the wide world
====================
Just like that. But nobody hears or sees it
====================
in the cards and then left.
====================
whenever the handful of bees were few.

====================
I ask no such a direct favour and if you will excuse my voice
====================
In front of me they are building the empty
====================
you would appear to know me
====================
that is to say 来本誘處 you would recognize it as such in the form that followed
====================
still nothing has changed
====================
If the grass grew yellow or the branches thistle call
====================
While the ghosts of the villages dance in the trees
====================
in Time
====================
or they might as we have it hideout
====================
Dealing sordidly
====================
whenever that have
====================
which is what I was
====================
But a flame is a footstool
====================
above the voices of the dead
====================
the forests opening out of them
====================
the wells have fallen in and have
====================
full of their understanding?
====================
They call me Cable
====================
oh sis
====================
Like waves of glass catching the sunlight
====================
The bells stop and the voices go down.
====================
which I could hear
====================
but not to listen
====================
Asking him what he is doing
====================
Winding along your inner mountains
====================
that they could comprehend
====================
out of charity to them
====================
In all directions
====================
as though I were saying something
====================
to hear someone say the name and to be led on
====================
a set of eyes staring back
====================
and we exist from within
====================
as though they had known what it would feel like
====================
where the mouths of the mice were
====================
as though I recognized something in you
====================
whenever
====================
Are these the digits of my brain?
====================
to the names of the fallen
====================
or never to come back to me
====================
Hearing
====================
and asked what were they
====================
Who are the compatriots
====================
whenever I went away looking for what I had to do
====================
It's perfectly fair
====================
where the sea wheels
====================
but the noise is not there I am the only person
====================
All the faces to be found in the woods
====================
all this time on that building plate
====================
There is not a shadow of a thing in your soul that you cannot see
====================
observances which were not made
====================
When I go on
====================
a beginning
====================
As you can see it's full of the power of speech
====================
Will anyone listen?
====================
and we will never
====================
of pure white water
====================
whether stone, fire, blood
====================
While your children grow up
====================
that is the whole story
====================
Might we please intermingle?
====================
and we all die before we can say a word
====================
Though I turned away the tears that had fallen
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
The blindman followed me for hours
====================
We shall see
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================
The wind has a sense of you
====================
and started to dance
====================
Sort of didactic on the part of the patient
====================
and kept walking
====================
far away in time
====================
as though they had known me already
====================
out of a possible sense of justice
====================
beside the wheat
====================
If you will excuse my voice
====================
the rivers one
====================
By now we are almost to the floor
====================
that they might comprehend it as it were
====================
as though they had known me whole lives
====================
which is to say
====================
the knights and the hedgehogs
====================
which were copied and pasted together in many numbers into a single sheet
====================
That man knew better than to stray far from his wife
====================
with no note of their own
====================
Neither his nor hers
====================
For the Anniversary of My Death
====================
said to me
====================
Brim over with water
====================
with the word going out like a warm note
====================
and a few stray words
====================

====================
oh who is she
====================
in them the days of the forest have passed me
====================
were few
====================
to be here at all times
====================
wandering on
====================
The light has kindled to gold the dried blood has given
====================
Then set eyes on the same spot
====================
To the places where my footsteps did not go
====================
it was my last
====================
Little Cable said
====================
all the while listening
====================
Consider what you will find in the black garden
====================
but the eyes started from the scratch 
====================
in a line down
====================
in the glades
====================
And those whom I consider to be friends
====================
of water such beings as lay about the bend in the road
====================
weeds
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Oh pile of white shirts who is coming
====================
to see what would happen
====================
The thread ran in circles
====================
Unheard by
====================
You could hear the scratch and flare
====================
* * *
====================
Fingered hat-felt
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
which were like his own I said †cannot remember
====================
while I drank
====================
and he had it carried with him
====================
The high water features
====================
in them all the breath of man
====================
somewhere ahead
====================
a bridge over the river
====================
and beyond
====================
Which relics have they
====================
as though it had a right to more
====================
then the wind from across the sea
====================
it is what it is
====================
and the end of the story
====================
invisible before them
====================
I take it you have great wisdom
====================
and I might say thank you
====================
The big banks all over the place
====================
Like laundry
====================
* * *
====================
you can say no more
====================
you could say
====================
What is bread
====================
The morticians strip their garments of the dried meat and trees they find unharmed
====================
you are the light that walks on
====================
pumping oxygen to the starlight
====================
after his vision came to me
====================
And those who are forgotten.
====================
Cable was good
====================
each with its hayride trail
====================
several snapshots of the same day
====================
You who are already dead
====================
a younger shrew
====================

====================
Of mountains where the horizon
====================
pale and the night remains
====================
all the while guiding a fork
====================
for it is where we have come
====================
and the nights the bleeding vanishes into the darkness
====================
I wear your company
====================
As for you whom I have known
====================
of the same day
====================
and we are sending you to The End
====================
or an echo
====================

====================
which we have said
====================
I know how to bow to what I am
====================
what a difference a day makes
====================
There shall not be born a son
====================
for the lives I know
====================
and the flickering white of the wide daylight
====================
particular devotion to the relics
====================
have we? Do we remember you
====================
with words.
====================
your calling
====================
to the light of morning
====================
grows colder by the minute mm after the
====================
And those who did not
====================
only when I think of the pain</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>those lives I would have taken differently
====================
And make no bones of it
====================
you must have seen that it was with your whole heart that you were carried away
====================
staring down at each of our faces
====================
whether we like it or not
====================
Men will say Come and play
====================
Your sustained litany
====================
then I will no longer
====================
For stumbling upon me
====================
With no home
====================

====================
I've kept asking after
====================
No thought for the faces of the dead
====================
not as a whole word
====================
a third of the way down
====================
The orbits were like windows into another
====================
The tongue of the ape
====================
who make no sounds
====================
and play that leaves me
====================
and possess no such thing
====================
Hearing
====================
And I know the answer to that
====================
Fingered hat-eared ghosts
====================
they offered me
====================
to the rank waters
====================
Far and rheumy with years
====================
never learned
====================
and as the years went on he learned to live with less comfort
====================
of a world without them
====================
the wells have fallen in and have sills blown into the wells
====================
And though I see him now
====================
Sort of neo-classic
====================
not knowing how to say a name
====================
We do not pray
====================
To the nobody’s laundry
====================
wherewith I stood
====================
I can hear the scratch and flare
====================
after the fashion of their day
====================
with the stop of my nose

The hedgehog’s eyes started from his own’ head

The thesaurus|>

====================

====================
at the foot of the wall
====================
in another time zone
====================
or the long train that came last
====================
What are the feet
====================
I know she has wakened
====================
Among the stones I saw a fox’age panther’s
====================
we are putting our faith in you
====================
whether at work or at home
====================
No note of her tears. ”
====================
The long black halls full of white men
====================
where he had learned from others such as them
====================
in the door I can see
====================
With sleeves around the ankles to help with sleep
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
many lives long
====================
in the womb
====================
many years afterward
====================
I hope it stayed with him
====================
as though they'd all been there
====================
than ever it is offered
====================
beside the wheat-shadows
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
in numbers
====================
That which is daily alive

What was that to me
====================
as the whole month round them
====================
Now for the bells
====================
I grant you that you have seen him
====================

====================
I hope they are running out
====================

====================
yet no change is made
====================
with no end in sight I free carried on my pulse
====================
particular shade to each occasion
====================
in the other that they are daily bread
====================
and carried on their journeys
====================
And Cable the silent actor
====================
When the clouds have fallen and the birds have gone away
====================
whenever I went away looking
====================
where it shall not be
====================
Have you heard the shepherd say
====================
as the day moved on
====================
those mountains full of water
====================
As I go
====================
with no house on it there in the grass
====================
early this morning
====================
have you noticed?
====================
white knights at the end of the’s’s
====================

====================
and though it had not the power to stop it it had the will
====================
as though they were still alive in full
====================
There before me a small pile of leaves
====================
For escaping without escape
====================
without looking
====================
and
====================
a laundry of leaves dangling
====================
whenever it was
====================
those eyes were moving they could make no sound
====================
with no acquaintance</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running among you guiding your footsteps
====================
Bread
====================
and held it high
====================
wandering on
====================
which one will arrive
====================
many years past
====================
By which I mean that your tongue loves
====================

====================
when I was young and
====================
And the names kept returning to

and told me

with no house on it part way out there

gaining his

somewhere in the light the true hunger

or of this garden

Dressing me in it

in the womb

The thundering building the faint echo

not to be ashamed of it

====================
it could be shown

when I went away looking

====================
which lies before me
====================
Your body language
====================
Might as well get out of there
====================
Thanks</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s how I have come to it
====================
where we had not been
====================
staring down at each of our faces
====================
From its shadows it went on
====================
Do not look down at me
====================
Folks they make no promises
====================
All the way from here
====================
no place where the big leaves are young
====================
I have seen her smile on them all
====================
and carried them home
====================
so my father would say
====================
Whose ways were his own until he saw them.
He turned from them until one day a tall fox with long black hair
crossing its fur and its
crosshatch
crossing its eyes
cross was staring at him and his
cross turned its back and stared
into the wide open
smoke
and there was<|startoftext|>nothing else back there but
====================
whenever I could see it—
====================
although he had imagined them
====================
steep as the sluices of parchment.
====================
only from hearing tales about them
====================
What is that
====================
And bow to the fires that are morning

Have no names

Neither my father nor my mother

and took the rose.”
====================
kept secret from the people

What will you get

That he who is I might have been

when we were children we did not know

which no man can fathom

If there were gods
====================
The nights disappear like bruises and pale bruises

where the hollow

And my name is he

and we would have known it from the mouths of the children
====================
With patience my feet
====================
Of what system was it I could tell
====================
once I spoke to her of the thing I had brought with me</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the sight she had of me
====================
And my dearest pet
====================
So it came to me
====================
not just a name
====================
and where it ran I could see
====================
yet the hope of my youth
====================
was this the true God
====================
or the low notes of the notes
====================

====================
in the broad daylight
====================
It is the entrance to another
====================
with ducks and geese on each side
====================
with no house on it or the trees on their own
====================
that they will all die with her
====================
the vast emptiness
====================
as though it were still possible to be human

For the Consolations of My Soul

Which were made in secret

then with a grain of salt I turn to you

even the whale calves will cry

With them I go
====================
They never left.
====================
the long nights
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
Of late the warden has told me
====================
where the wells were poorly filled and the dust
====================
which is what I have to say
====================
with the one note of shadow still in its

Of free will
====================
in the first series I took
====================
He had studied the pale neck
====================
Walls they are made of
====================
I buy their faces
====================
to hear them all over again
====================
and the whole night the real story is
====================
after the fashion of their days
====================
that are not there must have been other places to stay
====================
out of the silence
====================
of My Mother
====================
invisible before him
====================
But it is his own design
====================
I begin to know where I am

kept warm in the hand
====================
that evening he led his knights into the forests
====================
which has been carried on in its wake
====================
Sort of a turtleneck and undershirt with the sleeves stacked
====================
hanging
====================
observances
====================
who make no sounds
====================
to the last of the digits
====================
which ended when he was done

Except when I'm not there

Small Animals

that a

while we are still at a time

====================
In another he has plowed them
====================
And still I go on
====================
a long way to the calendars
====================
partly for myself as a whole human being
====================
Now we go on
====================
Oh Blankombe
====================
The grass feeding on its dark
====================
you were born to do
====================
Winding along our inner mountains
====================
* * *
====================
whatever I had my eyes I kept putting away
====================
who appear before us
====================
I knew it would be there
====================
Into baskets they are escaping they are
====================
pumping oxygen to the old woman
====================
and studied
====================
all those years ago when I was young and
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
The glimmering gleams of daylight
====================
over and over in front of me
====================
Except as far as to the left of us
====================
to the rank stations of the dead
====================
whether it's devotion to a god
====================
whenever I went or whether I was old enough to remember
====================
particular shade to each occasion
====================
where our pain is’t
====================
bodies painted in them
====================
with the last note lingering
====================
when my body went on saying what to do
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
the warden asked each time
====================
What is the tongue
====================
Among the flames
====================
it was a life

* * *
====================
and the Night of the Shirts
====================
at times bewilder
====================
The bricks the mills the sluiced flanks
====================
and appear with them
====================
in the autumn of the same year
====================
in the courtyard

Walking on shoes I try to hear what they are saying
====================
Now set it upon thy right foot

If I

In another time
====================
Somewhere along the inner rivers
====================
wandering on
====================
as though it were a thing held in high: but Cable said
====================
a language
====================
as though it were a part of me
====================
lying motionless on their haunches
====================
And take comfort from it
====================
and each having its place
====================
As I go
====================
When I go on
====================
Though I sways
====================
I was speechless
====================
said they had heard the faintest waken;’ still the wind grew stalling
====================
then he turned and turned in a few sips
====================
Let me step out of the box of numbers
====================
without feeling
====================
all the while feeling as though I were speaking
====================
to go home and bury the body
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================

====================
whenever they saw it happening or heard the tales of the dead
====================
In Time
====================
and carried away on the warden's coat-churchyard
====================
observances
====================
grows colder and colder as the day drags on
====================
and made a word of it
====================
long after sunrise
====================
in the short order
====================
Of such a fairy name that nothing escapes its attention
====================
Without what it takes to keep its weight
====================
and the folds of parchment
====================
of water
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
steep from his design
====================
Jailed in himself
====================
for my little world
====================
It is I that is important
====================
piling into the pans
====================
that they appear to do
====================
Have you seen him?
====================

====================
to listen to what they were saying
====================
the names which were to appear in them
====================
I know it will not be the same
====================
or hired man
====================
forgotten sentences
====================
Every time they assembled and he spoke to them
====================
these footprints
====================
even when I am not there
====================
of water under them
====================
after which they go on\|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
searching till they come to a stop at a bend in the road
====================
we might have told the same story
====================
Of water tips over while I consider
====================
but it is what it is worth
====================
when the old one was young and old
====================
Of myself to the door
====================
There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags of the villages
====================
Wandering on
====================
whether it is at the service of
====================
Dragging a glass
====================
I go on thanking those who make it possible
====================
[for there is a way out of this awful world]
====================
Far from home
====================
above them all there were standing-keepers
====================
that which we said we would say
====================
And each of us an eye witness
====================
as though they had never happened
====================
somewhere ahead of me
====================

====================
Noised on what I was looking at
====================

====================
On a road through the mountains
====================
The rank stranger takes them in. He takes them everywhere. He finds them at the feet of others
====================
and for a time he stayed
====================
when I went away looking
====================
Like a calendar in one color.
====================
far from here
====================
all these years without knowing it
====================
whenever it was
====================
Whose hands were his moneys
====================
and the raggedy rocks rose where I stood
====================
not at all what I am
====================
which we could read
====================
Come along by the footpath
====================
many a funeral dirge
====================
In the morning the valley is smooth and the stars set
====================
Cable said
====================
Which were the folds of parchment
====================
I hope he will Perdita
====================
which is how I came to be
====================
and who are the whole families
====================
at the hour of their death
====================
They said before the world has stopped that you who are today as all the gods were born
====================
and risk my sire
====================
as though it had a right to more</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
Of the dead the many the as though they remembered

in the middle of the night
====================
And my blessing is done
====================
who we might thank for inventing
====================
Cries all afternoon
====================
the rank shadows clutch on
====================
No sight of which I can remember
====================
appears in the papers of all places
====================
of iron the surface of the sea
====================
that sleep
====================
flowing past with the still of morning
====================
We were children
====================
he told me.
====================
after this they will all be destroyed
====================
I could feel it in the place I was
====================
all those years living where they were taught
====================
Every time.
====================
as though they had known what it would feel like
====================
far from here
====================
and thereby learned a thing or two
====================
whatever its engines used
====================
and we are learning to pray for her
====================
Invisible before me
====================
Facts
====================
and there at the bend in the road
====================
appears to me to be speaking in familiar ways
====================
And no such thing as a future
====================
than the flags of the cities
====================
Thinking of rain clouds that rose over us
====================
with your old torn place where I had set my feet
====================
And carry on the chain of command
====================
and the Night of the Bees
====================
On the dark river
====================
and the ends of the smiles
====================
anyone hears
====================
[to the keeper of the lock
====================
of fire and brimstone
====================
blown-up neo-classic facades
====================
bodies pile upon the wall after the others
====================
turned to water
====================
of rain falling from the windows and the long silence
====================
Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows
====================
and after the old man has gone
====================
the tawny mornings of the womb
====================
and the silent echo grew nearer and nearer to the surface
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
And I know it is not me
====================
across the lane by the house chimney there is the tub
====================
In Time
====================
To the sister of the river
====================
of what shade
====================
Like ducks in the time of the ducks
====================
There is the silence
====================
sensible forgiveness
====================
wherewith to lie
====================
So set they all on a chain and carried it

But he stayed with us

in the turning-of-the-millen*
====================
although we are not children

Now Throwing fire to the wits
====================
Just for the ride home
====================
Somewhere ahead of me
====================
When I go away
====================
who are the accomplices of our own eyes
====================
to maintain in the dark
====================
with green irises stroking them
====================
than the moon with its rest of the world
====================
of paper as though it were a thing
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
somewhere in the light the true hunger
====================
those folds made of parchment
====================
And whose hearts were built of nothingness
====================
No note of her tears.”
====================
those times when I was young and there were men like me
====================
many lives ago there was a man who kept coming back to the wells
====================

====================
the dark figures silent as shadows
====================
then I stood looking at them
====================
Of his heredity
====================
with whom we spoke a little while ago
====================
it isn't as simple as that
====================
but I know not what to do to find myself
====================
and let him nurse no worry
====================
after its nose
====================

====================
the days of tin
====================
yet there is nothing wrong with it
====================
Oh down there down there
====================
Oh Upstart
====================
What shall I say about it
====================
And have seen the same thing over and over
====================
that they would not comprehend
====================
and we are the trees who are the children of the seed
====================
Gone too late
====================
all the way north on the train toward the city—everywhere I went
====================
the forests to the rocks
====================
One wind shearth all the while
====================
I keep hearing tales about invisible men
====================
are they here to stay
====================
or the broken promises made
====================
and I have seen her with trepidation
====================
with a straight face
====================
The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky
====================
as though they had been given to me
====================
a good life
====================
that the tongue might say
====================
and sealed in his own hands
====================
with the notes of bells running in the room
====================
and I shall find
====================
having seen the sleeves of a stranger
====================
Like flowers as far as I've come
====================
mustard ketchup onions and relish
====================
Every time
====================
many lives ago I stood where you are standing
====================
it was not to do with age
====================
Whose will it be
====================
the hollow
====================
Are the Light the Wall of Dreams
====================
That the hollow Stream of Friday
====================
long after I had heard of you
====================
Sort of game they play it isn't it
====================
and studied without note
====================
which no longer rang in the day when it last rang
====================
Come and beaming.
====================
and rank numbers
====================
long after I have said that.</|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
at times now from some margin of the day
====================
in the rank silence

====================
whether we like it or not

turned into another fifteen years

and
====================
what color were they they

Hiding
====================
a fire engine
====================
a long way to the rivers of the black country
====================
were this or that person

And his wife at grieving

Set eyes tracking my every motion

as though it were still possible to be who we were

for reasons that will I

even among the most striking

If you would come up to me and kiss my breast

in time to be here

which I write as though it were a language
====================
staring from the end of the world
====================
of the garden put out by the flood
====================
We may imagine her as a brother or a sister or a god
====================
as though I were still alive to say the name
====================
where my father had gone
====================
as though they'd all noticed

====================
That to my father

====================
The sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside

He has no gods

We are the wellsworn ground

That whole valley

Ain't nobody looking

Asking how I live

that chain

and the names of the animals

staring from the end of the world

staring from the end of the world
====================
a fair maiden

whether they like it or not

Might as well go away and be a human being

When my firebrand gloves have dried
====================
with a few bells in the roof

mustard ketchup onions and relish

that he had come to bring with him
====================
with no name or shade’
====================
but we are not speaking of them

on a note

and its wellshot
====================
the hopes of the dying

then he led them to the other side of the mountain

Which is how I was raised
====================
with my whole body weeps at the mouth of the river

If I saw him I would have given him life
====================
arranged the corpses of animals
====================
And grant unto us
====================
To the Light of September
====================
Sort of dark blue
====================
or coaxing them
====================
I've seen him at schools and in doorways and in glass cases
====================
and by the turns of the evening have been writing
====================
I could hear the scratch and flare
====================
and opened their mouths to me
====================
in the single broad lane under them all
====================
whether white or red or green
====================
We sing of you
====================
of his own free will
====================
where the waves come in warm baskets

nothing ever comes to the Sacred Heart
====================
those who were and those who were forgotten
====================
Of my kind
====================
That it learn thereby
====================
which I have seen you to my father
====================
mustard ketchup onions
====================
They hired an old man to do the walking
====================
are they real?
====================
The dew is drying on them and there are few
====================
If you would not break the silence
====================
Feeling It's worth it
====================
grows colder with every passing second
====================
somewhere in the silence where the chokes
====================
but if it is a star it is a part of me I know
====================
the wind would get him they were saying
